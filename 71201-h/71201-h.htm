BETTY AT ST. BENEDICK’S
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL
</h3>

<p>
The whole family had come down to see Betty off.
</p>

<p>
Dad was there, although Betty felt that really
and truly he oughtn’t to spare the time.
</p>

<p>
The twins were there, because nothing on earth
would have kept them at home.
</p>

<p>
Even baby was there; though he wasn’t to be
called “baby” any longer, Aunt Frances had
decided.  Aunt Frances was holding his hand
now, and telling him to wave good-bye to Betty.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, <i>don’t</i> trouble him, Auntie!” said Betty
in a motherly tone.  “He so very rarely gets the
chance to see an engine really <i>start</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Dear old Bet,” said Auntie.
</p>

<p>
Auntie was a darling.  There was no doubt of
that.  If it hadn’t been that she was such a darling,
Betty couldn’t possibly have brought herself to
come away.  But it had all been arranged so
suddenly and unexpectedly, and almost without asking
her at all.
</p>

<p>
“You see, old lady,” Dad had said only a fortnight
ago, speaking one evening a few days after
Auntie’s arrival, in a voice which tried&mdash;though it
couldn’t quite succeed&mdash;to be in an ordinary, everyday
tone; “you see, you have looked after all of us
so long, Auntie says, that I’ve quite forgotten that
it’s I who ought to be looking after <i>you</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Dad!” Betty had said, staring.
</p>

<p>
Auntie hadn’t said it in Dad’s way.  She had
come along that evening after Betty was in bed.
She had sat on the edge too, and had hugged Betty
just the same way that Betty hugged Jan, the
twin.  “Bet, pet,” said Auntie, “you see, you’ve
got to go for Daddy’s sake!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Auntie!” Betty had said again, but in a
different tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
“It worries him to see you growing up like this,”
said Auntie.  “We don’t want to have a Betty
with white hair and worrying wrinkles before she’s
twenty.  And besides, I’m home now from India;
and Dad and I used to get on well enough when we
were children, you know.  So&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
So it was all arranged.  That was only a fortnight
ago, and now they were all down seeing her
off.
</p>

<p>
“St. Benedick’s, <i>Woodhurst</i>,” was written on
her red labels.  Betty was really going to school.
</p>

<p>
“If the train’s late in starting I really and truly
think that, Dad, you oughtn’t to stay,” said Betty,
leaning out.
</p>

<p>
But Dad stayed.  They all of them stayed.  They
all of them waved and waved and waved when
the train started off as though they would never,
never stop waving.
</p>

<p>
“I’m goin’ on wavin’,” shouted Jack, the twin,
running along beside the moving train, “till you
come back!”
</p>

<p>
“Go straight back to Auntie,” said Betty in a
very severe tone.  She was dreadfully sorry that
her last words had to be so strict-sounding;
but&mdash;suppose he got under the wheels!  And there
was Auntie, already fully occupied with holding on
to Jan and baby.  And Dad was just turning to
race up the station stairs&mdash;oh yes, Betty was glad
to see that.  She left the window as the train
entered the tunnel and sat down.
</p>

<p>
It was then that desolation seized her.
</p>

<p>
Never, never, never&mdash;so far back as she
remembered&mdash;had she felt so alone before!  Even at
night-time Jan’s small bed was tucked close to
her own, and at night-time Betty was always so
tired that she fell fast asleep and so couldn’t
possibly feel solitary.
</p>

<p>
But now&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“Oh, why ever did I come?” suddenly said
Betty.  “Oh, why ever did I think I’d like it?
Oh dear, oh, isn’t it dreadful of me!  Oh, I wish
I could turn round and go back.  I don’t believe
that I told Auntie about those early summer woollies
of Jan’s.  And suppose she catches cold.  And
Dad simply hates every kind of cocoa except Rowntree’s,
and I’ve never told her <i>that</i>; and we’re just
at the end of the tin.  <i>Oh!</i>”
</p>

<p>
Quite suddenly Betty began to cry.
</p>

<p>
“Oh dear,” she sobbed.  “Oh, I do, <i>do</i> hope
they’re not crying too!”
</p>

<p>
It was the thought of their possible tears that
made her forget to shed any more of her own.  Her
fingers groping for a handkerchief came across a
stubby pencil with which she had been drawing
pictures for baby.  In her case there was sure to
be paper; she would write them all a letter.  Betty
was smiling as she began “Dear Everybody”
at the top of the page, for she could almost see the
twins racing to the postman’s ring, and could almost
hear their shouts.  She felt at that moment almost as
much back at home as though she was really there.
</p>

<p>
“Dear Everybody...” began Betty.
</p>

<p>
The letter took a long time; it took away all
the marks of tears, too, from Betty’s face.  By the
time the junction was reached, and the train came
to a full stop, she was looking quite cheery and
eager again.
</p>

<p>
“No, I’m not getting out.  I was wondering,
though, if I could post this letter,” she began to a
passing porter, just as two Benedick girls came
along.
</p>

<p>
“Letter, eh?  We’ll do it for you!” said one
of them.  “See, there’s the red pillar.  No, no.
Don’t fuss; there’s plenty of time.  New girl,
are you?  Left something special at home?”  The
stranger took the envelope from Betty’s hand.
</p>

<p>
Betty had known that they were Benedick girls
from the colour of their labels.  They must be very
high in the school, she decided, as she watched
the pair of them, after depositing their traps on the
seat opposite to her own, walk in leisurely fashion
to the station post-box and return in equally leisurely
fashion.  She herself would have been all wings
and flying fingers; there was no “fuss,” as they
had called it, about them.  Almost instinctively
she pulled herself together a little and held herself
in imitation of their bearing.  But she couldn’t
refrain from jumping from her seat to reopen the
carriage door for them as they returned.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, thank you so much.  Now they’ll get it
at home.  Isn’t there anything I can do for
<i>you</i>?”  She tugged at the door.
</p>

<p>
“Easy does it.”  The handle was taken from her
grasp.  “Sit back, kiddy; we can’t get in.”
</p>

<p>
The speaker had a very nice voice; there was
no mistake about that.  So nice a voice indeed, and
so very kind and steady a smile, that Betty didn’t
mind in the very least being called “kiddy” by
a stranger, though never in her life had the term
been addressed to her before.  Never perhaps in
her life, either, had such a tone been addressed to
her.  Half-amused, half-tolerant, but clearly the
tone of her-who-must-be-obeyed.  Betty sat back
instantly.
</p>

<p>
She sat back and listened, for the strangers
began to talk.  They were evidently friends; so
much was certain.  It seemed certain, too, that
they had only just met after&mdash;as Betty decided
to herself&mdash;their holidays at home.  They evidently
didn’t mind her listening either, for their tones,
quiet and level as they were, did not seem in the
least lowered.  They were seated exactly opposite,
too, and the elder of the two&mdash;the girl who had
taken Betty’s letter and who had called her
“kiddy”&mdash;caught sight once or twice of the listening look
in Betty’s eyes and half-smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
Betty felt relieved and listened on.
</p>

<p>
But she felt bewildered too, because they
seemed to be talking of things about which she
herself had no knowledge at all.  Betty had known
that she would be ignorant at school compared
to other girls there; but she had, at least, so she
told herself, expected to understand the others’
language.
</p>

<p>
“I wonder if we shall manage another patrol
this term,” said the elder.
</p>

<p>
“‘Patrol’?” thought Betty questioningly.
</p>

<p>
“If so, we shall be a full company.  And there
will be still more competition for the Cup,” returned
her friend.  “You Daisies will have to work for it
if you’re to hold it next year too.”
</p>

<p>
This indeed was Greek.  Betty suddenly felt a
qualm of home-sickness sweep over her.  Where
would she be in a school where girls talked
understandingly of matters of which she had never heard?
Perhaps her feelings were shown by her expression
of face, for her first friend leaned suddenly forward
with a quick impulsive movement.
</p>

<p>
“Are you interested in Guides?”
</p>

<p>
“Guides?”  Betty shook her head.
</p>

<p>
“You haven’t heard of them?”  There was no
scorn in the speaker’s voice at all, though she
certainly did seem surprised.  “Why, then, what a
good thing you’ve decided to come to Benedick’s!
You’ll love it.  We’re all Guides there.  What is
your name?”
</p>

<p>
“Betty Carlyle,” said Betty rather shyly.
</p>

<p>
She had hardly ever felt shy before.  Generally
at home, when there were visitors&mdash;and that was
very seldom&mdash;she was so busy helping the little
ones not to be shy that she quite forgot to be shy
herself.  Now, however, she seemed suddenly to
find herself in an altogether new world.  If it had
not been for the kind look in the blue eyes which
were looking into her own, Betty would have felt
shyer.  But the eyes were very kind.
</p>

<p>
“Ask the kiddy her age, too, Sybil?” said
the second occupant of the carriage.  “She’s
above Brownie age, I think.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m thirteen,” said Betty, not understanding
the allusion in the least.
</p>

<p>
She felt rather shy of the second girl too, and
she was relieved when Sybil took up the conversation.
“Any age is Guide age,” said she with a
jolly look, “as you’ll soon decide.  I only wish
I could fit you into the Daisies; but I’m afraid
we’re a tight pack.”  Then she turned and, without
looking at Betty again, began to speak to her
companion about matters which seemed “just as
Greeky,” as Betty decided, “as before.”
</p>

<p>
But in spite of the “Greekiness” of things
Betty’s heart was beginning to feel quite light.
There was an excited sparkle in her eyes as she sat
back against the cushions.
</p>

<p>
For Sybil had said that Guides were jolly.  And
Sybil had said that she would make a good Guide,
and love it.  And Sybil had said that she wished
she could fit Betty “into the Daisies!”  Betty
had no glimmer of an idea what Guides, or patrols,
or “Daisies” were; but she was quite certain of
one thing, that if Sybil was to be a part of Benedick’s,
then, even if Betty herself was shy and stupid
at first, she would be sure to grow to love it,
because Sybil had said that she would.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
ARE YOU A DAISY?
</h3>

<p>
Betty was upstairs in the dormitory, battling
with a choky feeling that came and went just
because of the strangeness of it all.  But not
altogether an uncomfortable feeling, perhaps,
because it was something the same as feelings she
had experienced once or twice before when on her
way to parties, which, of course, she would be sure,
when once she got there, to enjoy!  Generally
at such times&mdash;which had happened very seldom&mdash;she
had had the twins with her; and there had been
always something to do for them on arrival which
had made her forget her own shyness.  For the choky
feeling was shyness, she decided.
</p>

<p>
She hadn’t felt shy with the older girls in the
train, not after Sybil had smiled at her.  She had
imagined then that everything would be
plain-sailing.  When the train had slowed down, too,
at Woodhurst Station, the two girls had helped
Betty out with her luggage, and she&mdash;who had
been Dad’s right-hand man during the journey to
the sea with the twins and baby last summer&mdash;had
wondered if they remembered that she had told
them she was aged thirteen!  But after that&mdash;well,
Sybil with her companion had seemed to melt
suddenly into space after telling the new girl kindly
to “wait there for Miss Drury,” and Betty had
unexpectedly found herself alone again, feeling
rather less than thirteen in courage as she seemed
suddenly to become encircled by a perfect whirlpool
of white panama hats, long brown legs, and
dark blue suits.
</p>

<p>
They were Benedick girls, of course, for they all
carried suit-cases with labels.  They wore the
Benedick hat-band, too, on their hats, and at first
each one of them, to Betty’s uninitiated eye, looked
identically the same as every other.  She noticed
presently, however, that although they all seemed
garbed exactly alike, some of them wore pigtails
and some of them had bobbed heads; that a few
of them seemed to glance at her in a friendly fashion
too, while others were too busy to notice her at all.
And she was beginning, rather despairingly, to
try to notice any other distinguishing features
there might be, when suddenly, from among the
chattering multitude, there emerged “one of the
bobbed heads,” as Betty called the individual to
herself, and came across.
</p>

<p>
“How awfully clever of you,” said the newcomer,
who seemed about Betty’s own age, with
a smile that showed a dimple, “to stand here under
the clock straight away.  Miss Drury’s down the
train looking for new girls.  They never guess,
of course, where to go.  But perhaps you’ve had
a sister, or an aunt, or a mother?”
</p>

<p>
The whole sentence was rather of a mystifying
order, but Betty didn’t care for that.  She pinned
all her hopes on the smile that showed the dimple,
and smiled back.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t know I <i>was</i> under the clock,” she said,
glancing up at the station clock above her head.
“But a girl&mdash;Sybil was her name&mdash;told me to
stand here, and then she went.  Is Miss Drury one
of the teachers?”
</p>

<p>
“A <i>mistress</i>.  Yes, rather,” the friendly girl
nodded.  “If you know Sybil, of course you’re all
right.  I only thought you might be shy and that
I’d speak to you before Miss Drury came.  Here
she is.”  Betty’s new acquaintance turned.  “I
always walk up with Phyllis,” she remarked; “we’ve
booked the walk every term from the station.
But I’m sure to see you later.  I’m Gerry.  Hope
you’re a Daisy!” she added, calling over her
shoulder in a jolly voice as she was lost in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Quite lost; one of a medley from which Betty
would have found it almost as difficult to find her
as to discover a needle in hay.  “And she’s a
Daisy too!” she found herself thinking.  “How
jolly they seem.  I should so much like to be one
too&mdash;whatever they are!”
</p>

<p>
There wasn’t much time, though, for conjecture
upon this point; the sudden arrival of the mistress
in charge made that plain.  “Only one new girl
this term.  Her boxes are here, but she&mdash;” she
was beginning in rather a puzzled voice.  “Hesther,
Louise, Gladys, have any of you&mdash;?  Oh, here
she is!”  Her eyes fell with evident approval upon
the figure of Betty, standing stiff as any grenadier,
under the clock.
</p>

<p>
“How very sensible of you to follow the others,”
remarked she in a downright voice, “and to come
straight here.  So few of the new girls do, and the
train is such a long one.  Now fall in, please.”  Miss
Drury’s tone was breezy and her look travelled
quickly from Betty to the whirlpool which, almost
like magic, seemed to sort itself into instantaneous
couples at the sound of her command.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, we’re all here now, I think.  Phyllis and
Gerry will lead off.  But wait outside the station,
please, for a moment as usual, until I give the word
to start up the hill.  There should be twenty-six
of you here, and I must make sure.”  Then, as she
brought up the rear herself, Miss Drury&mdash;ignoring
fervent requests from three evident admirers&mdash;turned
again in Betty’s direction and threw her a
friendly glance.
</p>

<p>
“Betty Carlyle?  Yes, come along.  No, Marie
and Brenda, will you make the last couple, please;
I have only two sides, as you know, and Betty has
no partner.  Clare&mdash;yes, you may walk with me
too.”
</p>

<p>
Betty found herself, therefore, making a threesome,
stepping out with as steady a stride as she
could manage, and feeling a distinct twinge of awe
in her heart.  For Miss Drury, on whose right side
she walked, seemed to the new girl as much unlike
a “teacher” as any one could possibly be.  The
books at home were rather old-fashioned certainly,
and they had generally depicted the mistresses of
schools as being gaunt ladies in specs and mittens.
Miss Drury, however, was as unlike the
“specs-and-mittens” type as any one could possibly be.
</p>

<p>
She reminded Betty of the golf-playing ladies
on the links at the seaside last year from whose
furious hitting she had protected the ubiquitous
twins, who had been consumed with a mania to
stray on the greens hunting for “lost balls.”  For
Miss Drury wore brogues and a sports coat; she
looked, Betty found herself thinking, “like the jolly
older sister of one of the girls, instead of anybody
teachery.”  The very words of her conversation
with Clare, who walked on the mistress’s left hand,
sounded altogether unschooly, Betty thought.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Clare, it certainly was rather a risk,
perhaps, to go camping in the Easter holidays; but
the weather forecast was so good that I decided
to take advantage of it.  If we are to have a camp
this term&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Miss <i>Drury</i>!”
</p>

<p>
Clare was evidently listening feverishly while
the mistress expatiated fervently on the interests
and excitements of an Easter camp when the winds
had been so strong that their tent was blown
sky-high during the process of being pitched by an
inexperienced camper; when the tent canvas had
apparently shrunk dreadfully after an April deluge;
and when a tent pole had cracked at midnight with
direful consequences to all concerned.  “But all
I can say is,” finished up the mistress, “that I
never gained such good experience at first hand in
my life.  The more you pay for experience the more
good you get from it.”  Then, in the quick direct
and very kindly way which Betty had already
realized as characteristic, Miss Drury turned to
speak to the new girl at her side.
</p>

<p>
“Are you a Guide?” she asked kindly.  “No?
Well, I am very glad, for your sake then, that you
have come to St. Benedick’s just when you have.
Thirteen, are you not?  Quite a junior.  You
have plenty of time to work up for your badges,
you know.”
</p>

<p>
“I hope you’ll be a Cowslip,” put in Clare,
smiling across from Miss Drury’s other side.  “Oh,
Miss Drury, I do hope&mdash;”  The talk began again.
</p>

<p>
But Betty had already decided that, if she had
anything to do with the matter, she would be a
Daisy rather than any other flower of the field!
She was still firmly of the same opinion when the
lodge gate was reached and the school came in
sight.
</p>

<p>
Not a large house, but an old one.  Standing,
as it did, in well-wooded grounds, it looked still
almost as it must have looked long ago&mdash;an
unpretentious old family mansion, which had not been
built for school purposes, but whose quiet atmosphere
of age and dignity had yet changed wonderfully
little since the coming of the Benedick girls some
ten years back.
</p>

<p>
From the lodge gate through which the crocodile
of girls entered the old house could be seen at once,
with its mullioned windows and twisted chimneys,
with its creepers which would be red-golden in the
autumn but which were now glad-green.  It was
lit up with the late afternoon sun, and seemed,
against its background of dark whispering trees,
as though smiling kindly at the returning girls.
The house was faced with green lawns, as well and
trimly kept as they had ever been before the school
had taken possession there.  Its gardens, through
which the big drive wound up to the great main
door, were old-world gardens still.  Beds of
old-fashioned roses, tiled paths, clipped yew trees, an
ancient sundial&mdash;the impression of the whole was a
quiet one.  Rooks cawed from the tall old elms
behind the house; the trees in the grounds through
which the girls walked seemed old and full of years.
</p>

<p>
“Is <i>that</i> St. Benedick’s?” asked Betty, wondering.
</p>

<p>
For somehow, though she couldn’t exactly have
explained her feelings on the matter, though she
didn’t perhaps realize that she had had as yet
any ideas as to what the school buildings would
be like, now she knew that she had expected
something far more modern and ordinary&mdash;nothing
exactly beautiful like this.  And yet there was
a “something” in the bearing of all the girls&mdash;a
“something” she had noticed more in the two
seniors of the train, perhaps, than in the juniors,
and most of all in Sybil&mdash;a “something” which
was akin to the feeling that this old building gave.
</p>

<p>
“No fuss,” it seemed to say as it stood there
beautiful as though from unhurried age.  “Easy
does it.”  Almost the first words she had heard
Sybil utter had been just those.  So many years
it had taken for the beauty of the old house to grow.
The age of hurry-scurry had never had a part in
the making of this old mansion.  It seemed to stand
with gentle, kindly dignity, holding its memories,
cherishing them as some treasure among the trees,
which perhaps held older memories still.
</p>

<p>
Betty felt a throb at her heart.  It was <i>wonderful</i>
to come to school in a house like this.  Her eyes
were still fixed on the old building, lit up with the
afternoon sun, as Miss Drury spoke.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” her voice was quiet and seemed to match
with the scene, as though she, too, saw what Betty
saw, and understood, for all her talk of camping
and for all the modern breeziness of her manner.
“This is St. Benedick’s.  Miss Carey likes to keep
the grounds just as they were.  The playing-fields
are right away from the house, though we use the
grounds, of course, for Guide practices.”
</p>

<p>
The procession of girls had wound by this time
in orderly fashion along the drive, between the
old-world garden lawns and beds, and through the
great doors which seemed&mdash;so Betty thought&mdash;glad
to open to them.  Then, as she followed on
herself, the very last of the line, she forgot the
first impressions that the old house had given her.
For Miss Drury was addressing an individual in
a starched cap and apron who stood at the foot of
the wide stairway.
</p>

<p>
“The only new girl; Betty Carlyle, Nurse.  I
will hand her over to you while the others go
straight to the cloakrooms.”
</p>

<p>
Betty found herself, therefore, ascending the
stairway step by step with a sudden longing for
a twin on either side.  The sense of dignity and
mystery that the first sight of the old house had
given her was gone now.  There were echoing sounds
of voices and laughter, greetings and meetings
down below, in which she had no share.
</p>

<p>
“Your room is number three, and you’ll share
it with Mona and Geraldine and Irene,” Nurse was
remarking in a tone which seemed as starchy as her
uniform.  “And so I trust you are not an untidy
girl.”
</p>

<p>
Three minutes afterwards Betty, having tiptoed
along passages which seemed scented both with
the old-fashioned flowers whose perfumes were
wafted through the widely-opened windows and
also with nowadays beeswax and turpentine, found
herself seated inside a cubicle that was to be “all
her own.”
</p>

<p>
It was then that the shyness came back.
</p>

<p>
If only she’d had Jan’s frock to change, or Jack’s
bootlace to unknot!  Of course she knew that
school was really going to be lovely&mdash;her first
acquaintance with Sybil, and Gerry, Miss Drury,
and, yes, even with the old house itself, had assured
her of that; but if only there had been somebody
there who needed her as they all had needed her at
home!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
AT THE WINDOW TABLE
</h3>

<p>
“I just half-guessed you’d be in our room,” said
Gerry.  “That was why I couldn’t help speaking
to you in the station.”
</p>

<p>
She had dimpled herself into Betty’s cubicle,
and had perched herself, still dimpling, on the
side of Betty’s bed.  Her hat had been left
downstairs, and a mass of red-to-golden hair seemed
almost to glitter as she sat there.  To Betty’s
admiring eyes she seemed a glittery sort of person
altogether.
</p>

<p>
“When I saw you standing under the clock,”
continued Gerry, as the dimple came and went, “I
said, ‘That’s <i>her</i>!’”  She broke off suddenly&mdash;not
to correct her grammatical lapse, but to start
in surprise at the sound of a louder voice than her
own.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Geraldine!</i>” said the outraged voice.
</p>

<p>
“Oh!” cried Gerry with an apologetic squeak.
</p>

<p>
She rose from the white coverlet as she squeaked,
and was attempting to remove certain creases as
Nurse drew back the curtain.
</p>

<p>
“In another girl’s cubicle, and before half an hour
of the term has passed, Geraldine!” remarked the
starched and stately dignitary.  “I had two
thoughts about putting a new girl in here at all;
for with you so forgetful and all, how’s she to learn
the rules?  Rumpling the covers&mdash;!”  Nurse bent
down and smoothed the coverlet herself; “and
she younger than you, and needing teaching!”
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-021"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-021.jpg" alt="I just half-guessed you’d be in our room.">
<br>
“I just half-guessed you’d be in our room.”
</p>

<p>
Nurse’s tone was majestic in its intonation, and
a subdued voice came in reply from the other
end of the room where Gerry had fled to her own
domain.
</p>

<p>
“Nurse, I honestly forgot.  I’ll really remember.
In three weeks, you know, one can forget such
lots of things!”
</p>

<p>
But Nurse replied not at all, and apparently
making no allowance for this extenuating
circumstance, turned to Betty instead.  “You’re ready
now?  Well, Geraldine may take you downstairs
when the tea-gong rings.  You will see Miss Carey
afterwards; but first of all she wishes you to have
your tea.”
</p>

<p>
Nurse withdrew, and the closing of the door
behind her seemed to serve to loosen the tongue of
Gerry, who burst into a flood of conversation
without delay.
</p>

<p>
“I <i>did</i> forget.  Honest Injun, I did.  We’re not
allowed in each other’s cubicles without permission,
though we may have the curtains drawn back.
Nurse is most awfully strict; but she’s not really
so strict as she seems.  For one thing,” Gerry sighed,
“she might have lost me a dormitory mark, but
she didn’t.  I’d like to have seen Mona’s and Irene’s
faces if I’d lost one.  We’re all Daisies, you see,
and&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
The speaker broke off as the sound of a loud but
very melodiously-toned gong boomed somewhere
from the regions below.  Tea-time; there was no
doubt of that; and the new girl was thankful of
Geraldine’s presence at her side as the pair made
their way down the wide and shallow stair.
</p>

<p>
She was still more thankful that she was not
alone when they had reached the bottom, for their
progress was held up there on the lowest step as
the school filed its way dining-room wards.  Along
the corridor, in a single line, without hurry and
without words, came&mdash;first of all&mdash;the older girls,
then the junior girls behind.  Gerry waited till they
had filed past, and then took her own place at the
end with Betty beside her.  It felt wonderful to
Betty to take her place, too, by right in the
procession; there were thirty-three of them altogether,
counting Gerry and herself, for she had numbered
every one while they were passing.  There would
have been only thirty-two girls at St. Benedick’s
if <i>she</i> were not there, she told herself; but she was
here, and so there were thirty-<i>three</i>!  The delicious
thought made her gulp with pride.
</p>

<p>
She forgot the pride, though, for shyness again,
just for a little while, when the dining-room door was
reached.  At home meals were generally eaten in
a basement room, to save trouble for the general
servant whose duties were so never-ending.  Here
the very idea of a meal in such a lovely room made
Betty gasp with shyness at first, and then realize
suddenly how hungry she was!
</p>

<p>
The dining-room ceiling overhead was oak-beamed;
the walls were panelled in dark oak
too; the mullioned windows which lined one side
of the wall were all thrown widely open, and the
scent of stocks and pinks seemed to fill the room.
</p>

<p>
A big bowl of pinks, too, stood in the middle of
each of the three tables, one of which&mdash;of circular
shape&mdash;was smaller than the others.  This round
table was placed in the very centre of the room, and
was flanked on either side by a longer and narrower
one.  Betty, standing in the doorway, saw six
senior girls take their places at the round table,
while a line of junior girls, each evidently taking
her own seat by right, advanced to each of the
narrow tables in quiet file.
</p>

<p>
“Geraldine, please take Betty Carlyle to the
window table with you,” came the voice of a
mistress standing at the door.
</p>

<p>
It was all so quiet and orderly, and yet it didn’t
feel “ruley.”  Every girl, as Betty took her place
at the corner of her table, seemed cheerily smiling
at her neighbour as though thoroughly contented
with her lot.  The new girl felt contented too, but
her feeling of contentment changed suddenly to one
of surprise when, after listening to the words of
the Grace pronounced by the mistress in charge,
every tongue seemed suddenly unloosed all round
her, and the room began to buzz and hum with
animated conversation.
</p>

<p>
“Well, as I was just beginning to tell you when
the gong sounded, we&mdash;” burst out somebody
sitting close by and speaking to her table neighbour.
</p>

<p>
“The day Paul broke his ankle, I can tell <i>you</i>,
First Aid came in useful,” pronounced somebody
else with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
“I started at nine, and I hardly had <i>any</i> lunch,”
came a ravenous voice.
</p>

<p>
Everybody seemed to have something to say
except Betty, and she didn’t need to talk to Gerry
at her side; for Gerry, evidently keen to make her
companion feel at home, burst into a glib and
speedy description of their immediate surroundings.
</p>

<p>
“That’s Mona opposite to you.  She sleeps in
our room.  She’s talking to Molly now, but I’ll
make her look presently.  We don’t talk across
tables, you know.
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t it nice that you’re a ‘window-table’
girl!  It’s much the nicest table, <i>we</i> say, though
the ‘wallflower-table’ girls (that’s what we call
the girls at the wall table) say they can see far
farther over the garden than we can.  All the same
we sometimes get bees flying right in, and once a
butterfly too.”  Gerry stopped for breath.
</p>

<p>
“I love this table,” said Betty shyly.
</p>

<p>
“So do I.  That’s Joan Struthers taking the
head to-night.  She’s a prefect.  You can tell
them&mdash;if they <i>need</i> telling&mdash;because their hair’s
turned up.  Even if it’s been bobbed, it has to
grow <i>then</i>!  There’s seven prefects, but only six
places are ever laid at the prefects’ table, you see,
because one of them always heads a table.  Miss
Stewart’s at the wallflower table this week; but
she will be at this table next week&mdash;in fair turns,
you see&mdash;and the wallflower girls will get a
prefect.”  Gerry took a mouthful of scrambled eggs.
</p>

<p>
Betty took a mouthful, too, and gazed across
at the middle table.  Then suddenly she flushed
with pride and pleasure as a friendly smile met her
inquiring look.  For Sybil was seated there&mdash;Sybil
of the train journey.  In all the excitements Betty
had almost forgotten her, but it seemed that the
older girl had not forgotten Betty.  How quiet
and dignified she looked, Betty thought, as she
sat there with a golden braid of hair wound in a
coronet round her head.  “There&mdash;there’s the girl
who told me to stand under the clock,” she
whispered, touching Geraldine’s arm.
</p>

<p>
Gerry nodded.  “That’s Sybil.  She’s the head
of our patrol.  She’s head girl too this term of
the school.  Our patrol is the Daisies.  I’m in
it; and Mona and Irene as well.  We’ve got four
patrols at school, you know; there are the Buttercups
and the Cowslips and the Foxgloves as well
as us.  I don’t see how you can possibly be in our
bedroom without being a Daisy; but, you see&mdash;”  Gerry’s
tone broke off in rather a worried note.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I do hope&mdash;” began Betty feverishly, just
as silence fell suddenly upon the room as Miss
Stewart tapped on the table.
</p>

<p>
“Girls, go straight to the Oak Room, as you
always do on the first day.  Miss Carey is ready
for you now.”
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the Oak Room had been used in the
early days as a banqueting hall, for a musicians’
gallery ran round the four walls overhead.  Perhaps
stately family festivals, banquets, and ceremonial
feasts had taken place here in years gone
by.  But for all that, the old pictures still hanging
on the walls seemed to look down tolerantly on the
girls of to-day as they entered.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps, too, it was the sight of them all&mdash;young,
gay, simple-hearted, and with life stretching
so invitingly before them&mdash;standing in the room
that held so many echoes of the past, which made
the headmistress when she entered pause for a
moment and look down at them quietly before she
spoke.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely an opening speech could her words be
called, for her words were, as usual, few.  But
even before Miss Carey had opened her lips some of
the waiting girls had felt themselves under the
influence of what she had come to say.
</p>

<p>
Slight and straight she stood there; somehow,
in her quiet and gentle but forceful dignity, she
seemed, as always, with her understanding appreciation
of the beauty of things past, and with her
power to see beauty in things present, to be a link
between the house which had belonged to yesterday
and the girls of to-day.  “<i>Festina lente.</i>”  (It
was the school motto that she took as her
text&mdash;“Hasten slowly.”)  She spoke of the old house
which sheltered them.  “We could not have a
happier setting for a school with our motto,” said
Miss Carey.  “Every day that we spend here
should teach us more of what our motto means.
Years and years have passed as it has stood
here, and its beauty has grown.  ‘<i>Festina lente</i>’
seems to me to have been its motto too.  No fuss;
no undue haste; until now, in the full beauty of
its age, it has given us shelter, and we can learn
here the lesson which is so difficult to learn in the
busy world of to-day.
</p>

<p>
“Outside, in life, there is so much hurry-scurry
nowadays.  You, who are one with the outside
life, and must take your share in it later, are spending
certain years here to fit you for your life outside.
And these years should be for you later on, I like
to think, a treasure which, in the storm and stress
that life must bring to each of us, no one can take
from you.  Quiet memories will be yours of a time
when&mdash;helped perhaps more than you realize now
by the atmosphere and influence of this house
itself&mdash;you, each one, laid up a store of strength
for later days.
</p>

<p>
“And because, here at St. Benedick’s, we ‘study
to be quiet,’ you will not be the less fitted, I think,
when you leave for the world outside, if you go out
remembering that in quietness and in confidence
is your greatest strength.  No, all I have to say to
you at the opening of this term can be summed
up again, I think, in our motto: <i>Festina lente</i>
(Hasten slowly); for nothing in life is worth having
that can be gained by snatching.  Our motto means
much, and it may grow to mean more and more
through life to each one of you if you will remember
it.  Hasten slowly; and ‘Patience, then, will have
her perfect work.’”
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
IN THE BIG OAK HALL
</h3>

<p>
“Attention!  Patrols, form lines!  Right turn!
Lead out!”
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, at the close of the little speech, the
orders had come.  Just as Betty was wondering
why it was that Miss Carey’s words&mdash;even although
she could understand very little of their meaning&mdash;had
yet left a queer restful sort of feeling in her
excited mind, the headmistress had paused, her
tone had changed, and the orders had been uttered
in quiet but clear and decisive tones.
</p>

<p>
And in response every girl in the room had
drawn herself up.  Then, in amazement, Betty
had watched as four of the prefects had stood out
from the rest, and as the other girls, each evidently
understanding the meaning of the orders, had
quietly taken a place in one of the four lines.  Betty,
following Geraldine’s movements with her eyes,
had noticed that her late companion now stood
quietly at the end of a row of juniors which seemed
to be under the charge of Sybil, the head girl.
Six other juniors stood there with her, one of whom
Betty recognized as Mona, though the rest were as
yet unknown.  While she was wondering whether
she, too, had a place in the ranks, the second order
had come from the lips of the headmistress, and
quietly, in orderly fashion, the four prefects had
led their patrols from the room.
</p>

<p>
On the floor of the big Oak Hall Betty found
herself alone; but as she turned, wondering whether
to follow the rest, the new girl found the
headmistress at her side.
</p>

<p>
“You are Betty Carlyle, my dear?”
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-029"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-029.jpg" alt="You are Betty Carlyle, my dear?">
<br>
“You are Betty Carlyle, my dear?”
</p>

<p>
It was quite impossible to be afraid of Miss Carey.
Betty suddenly thought, as she looked up and met
the kind look in the headmistress’s eyes, of deep
pools of blue water&mdash;deep, very deep.
</p>

<p>
But it was depths of feeling, hidden deeper still
but mirrored in the eyes, which unconsciously she
had noticed.  Buried there were the signs of
sorrows bravely borne, but hidden now; buried deep
were all the troubles that life had brought her.
But buried deep, too, were reserves of strength
wrought from triumph over trial; reserves of
sympathy gained after sorrows bravely borne.  Betty
did not understand this.  She only somehow felt
that the lines on the face which looked kindly
and keenly into her own had “fallen in pleasant
places”; that the eyes seemed as true as they
were blue; and that the smile on the quiet lips
was the sweetest smile that she had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“And you think you will be happy here, my dear?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, only&mdash;” Betty’s voice quivered a little.
For the “only” meant a great deal just then.
School, wonderful though it was, seemed to hold
so many mysteries still.  The other girls seemed
still beings apart.  Just as she stood alone in the
big Oak Hall now she felt alone somehow.  And
at home it had been so different.
</p>

<p>
“Only you do not feel in touch with our ways
yet?”  The voice had seemed as kind as the eyes.
“To-morrow, by this time, you will feel differently,
I am quite sure.  And then&mdash;”  Miss Carey had
crossed the room while she spoke, while Betty
walked at her side.  Together they had reached
the corridor again.  “And then you may come to
me at this time,” said the headmistress, “and
tell me if what I say now has not come true.  Now
can you find your way up to your dormitory alone?
Nurse is up there waiting for you, I know.”
</p>

<p>
Very few words; but Betty suddenly felt different.
It had needed just that to settle her, she
decided.  Even although the girls seemed sometimes
to speak a different language from her own, to
have ways quite different from any she had known,
yet soon they would be her ways too.  She went
upstairs on flying wings.
</p>

<p>
Flying wings, however, met with a poor reception
from Nurse, the disciplinarian of the dormitories.
Order and method were the burden of her speech.
Betty, during the half-hour which preceded the
arrival upstairs of her dormitory companions, underwent
an introductory training in dormitory behaviour.
</p>

<p>
“Who packed your box for you?  You yourself?
You’ll pack it differently to go home with!
See these creases?  Fine work wasted, that’s what
<i>that</i> is!  Down to the laundry these go to-night for
some one else to iron.  And that’s poor thanks to
the one who spent time in doing the work before!”
</p>

<p>
Betty found herself flushing, half with surprise
and half with shame.
</p>

<p>
“Now this chest of drawers is your own, of
course; but each girl keeps her linen in the top
long drawer, and her blouses&mdash;”  On wound the
lesson while the new girl stood submissively by.
“The right-hand small drawer you may keep for
what you like.  Your handkerchiefs and gloves go
into the left-hand small drawer.”
</p>

<p>
Nurse was by this time locking the box.
</p>

<p>
“They’re in, Nurse.  Everything is.  It’s
finished,” replied Betty, longing for praise from
this stern critic.
</p>

<p>
“‘In,’ you say?  Let me see.  Now why waste
time by saving it to do nothing in?  That’s what
you’ve done.  Hurry-scurried over the business and
don’t know where your things are.  Tell me without
looking inside now, which end of the drawer did
you put your Sunday gloves?”
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;”  Betty stood still, unable to remember.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t know.  I don’t blame you to-day.
But you’ll arrange this differently, I hope, before
I’ve done with you.  We’ve all got the same amount
of time&mdash;all the time there is!  Some of you think
that if you hurry-scurry over what you’ve got to
do, that you save some of it for something else.
They’ve generally wasted it instead, as they find
out!  Now there’s ten minutes of the half-hour
left before the rest come up, so you can take your
things out of this drawer and lay them in again.
‘A place for everything, and everything in its
place,’ may be an old-fashioned proverb in some
places,” finished up Nurse, “but not at St. Benedick’s.
And neither is the tale of the ‘Hare and
Tortoise.’  It comes true <i>here</i> every day!”
</p>

<p>
There was much wisdom in Nurse’s words.  In
her own characteristic way she was voicing, as Betty
somehow realized, the spirit that lay under the
school motto.  The new girl slowly and methodically
did as she was told while Nurse stood looking
on.  Anyhow, so she told herself, she was already
learning one way of being like the rest of the girls!
</p>

<p>
For how different the drawers looked from those
in her bedroom chest at home.  A muddled jumble
of her own things and Jill’s had generally to be
stirred round about before an odd glove, or a
possible bootlace, or a cleaner handkerchief could be
found.  Even while Nurse’s first words of
commendation were sounding in Betty’s ears, even
although she was beginning to feel herself more
like the rest, Betty’s heart gave a terrible thump
of longing for home.
</p>

<p>
It was at that juncture that “the rest” came
upstairs to bed&mdash;each of the two dormitory
companions with whom she had not as yet made friends,
evidently as keen to know Betty as Geraldine had
been.
</p>

<p>
“Gerry’s just behind.  She stopped for something.
You’re Betty Carlyle, aren’t you?  Rene
and I have been longing to talk to you.”  Thus
Mona in a breathless torrent.  “I tried to smile
across at tea, because we don’t talk over the table;
only you weren’t looking.  And then came Miss
Carey’s speech, of course, and then came the Guide
meeting, and so&mdash;”  The curtains of Mona’s cubicle
had been drawn right back, and she was waving a
hair-brush while Rene, although it was evidently
difficult for her to get a word in edgeways, smiled
and nodded in friendly fashion, as though in perfect
agreement with her friend’s sentiments.
</p>

<p>
Rene was small and dark; Mona was tall, and
owned a corn-coloured pigtail.  They were both
jolly looking, Betty thought; though perhaps not
quite so specially jolly as Geraldine.  The latter
entered the bedroom three minutes after the other
pair, panting as she came.
</p>

<p>
“I was dreadfully afraid I’d be late.  I waited
to ask Sybil something after Guides.  You see&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“‘Guides’?”  It was the second time the word
had been used.  So the girls had been “Guiding,”
had they, during the half-hour which Betty had
spent unpacking!
</p>

<p>
“Guiding!  Rather.”  Rene and Mona took
up the word and smiled.  “Gerry says you’re not
one.  She was telling Sybil.  Sybil said she knew
already, and she said, too, that it’s a dreadful pity
we can’t fit you into the Daisies.  But, of course,
we can’t <i>possibly</i>, because&mdash;”  Mona stopped short
and shook her hair out of its pigtail, while Rene
took up the tale.
</p>

<p>
“Nor into the Foxgloves either, can they?
They’re as full as us.  And the Buttercups too.
Cowslips could have taken you in last term; but
Bunty’s here now.  She came last half-term, and
as she’d been a Guide before, she went straight in.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Oh!</i>” cried Betty disappointedly.  She knew
suddenly how very much she had wanted to be a
Daisy, if only because then she would definitely
belong to something which held Sybil and Gerry
too.  She looked across at Gerry, who hadn’t
contributed one word yet to the conversation, but who
was labouring solidly with her mop of hair.  There
was rather an excited look in her eyes, however,
as they met Betty’s pair of disappointed ones.  “I
<i>did</i> so hope&mdash;” began Betty quaveringly.
</p>

<p>
“There’s eight girls in the Daisies, you see,
already,” said Mona informatively.  “And there’s
eight in each of the other patrols, because this
term there’s thirty-three at school; and four eights
make thirty-two.  Of course, you’re an extra,
counting that way.  Sybil said that if there’d
been more new girls we might have had another
patrol; but with only <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;!”
</p>

<p>
Mona was well-meaning if tactless; she did not
guess that Betty felt a gulp in her throat at the
words.
</p>

<p>
“Not, of course, that you could exactly be in
<i>any</i> patrol <i>yet</i>,” went on Mona in a would-be
comforting tone, “because you don’t know <i>anything</i>!
Not the Guide law, do you?  Nor the promises?
Nor the Union Jack?  Nor even knots?  So&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Betty’s face grew longer and longer.  She seemed
to be going farther and farther into loneliness
and insignificance at each mention of these
qualifications, none of which she possessed.  She didn’t
know <i>anything</i>, she agreed mentally, that these
girls did.  If only Gerry would speak up for her
it would have been some comfort, but Gerry still
steadily brushed at her hair.  Betty’s heart gave
a leap of hope, however, as Rene, comb suspended,
gave a sudden excited cry.
</p>

<p>
“I tell you what Sybil might let you do!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>What?</i>” inquired Betty breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
“There’s a thing you could be!  It’s in the
Guiding Book.  You don’t know anything, you see,
like Mona says.  But you might be a Lone Guide,
I believe.”
</p>

<p>
A big tear, the existence of which she had been
hitherto unaware of, suddenly half-blinded one of
Betty’s eyes.  For she didn’t want, she told herself,
to be any more “alone” than she felt already.  She
didn’t know what Guiding was, one bit; but she felt
quite sure that she didn’t want to be a Lone one!
The very sound of the word made her feel so
dreadfully home-sick that she couldn’t believe Miss
Carey’s promise to her <i>could</i> come true, and that
this time to-morrow she would be feeling like one
of the rest.  As she turned to look in the glass and
to wink away the tear, there came a tap at the
door, and Gerry, springing suddenly forward, gave
a squeak of joy.
</p>

<p>
“<i>There!</i>” said Gerry, throwing a dimply look
at Betty.  “I knew Sybil would manage it.  I
<i>knew</i> she’d come!”
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE DAISY MASCOT
</h3>

<p>
It was Sybil’s face that looked in at the door.  She
was smiling, and her eyes were bright.  “May I
come in?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Sybil!</i>” arose a chorus of surprise, and Betty
realized at once from the sound of amazement in
the tones of Rene and Mona that this apparition
was as unexpected to them as to her.  A dormitory
visit from the head girl must evidently be considered
in the light of a kind of miracle.  Their brushes
hung suspended in mid-air; they tore back the
curtains of their cubicles feverishly for a better
view; their eyes and mouths were open.  Only
Gerry, still dimpling secretly to herself, took no
part in the squeaks and squeals of wonder.
</p>

<p>
Sybil took no notice of them either.  Coming
in, she closed the door softly, and stood just inside.
“I have Miss Carey’s leave to come,” she said
quietly; “and Nurse knows too.  Now which&mdash;”
she stopped short and looked round the room&mdash;“is
Betty Carlyle’s cubicle?”
</p>

<p>
“This!” said Gerry in a triumphant voice,
pointing with her brush, and speaking in a tone of
suppressed ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
In another moment Sybil had stepped across the
polished floor, through the curtains, and inside.
</p>

<p>
Miracle of miracles, too, she seated herself with
a smile on Betty’s bed; miracle of miracles, one of
her arms went round Betty’s waist as the little new
girl stood there, brush in hand, still trying to
swallow down the remembrance of her ignorance “of
everything,” and still fighting against the idea of
being a “Lone Guide.”
</p>

<p>
But everything seemed to change suddenly with
the appearance of the head girl, and with the
comfortable feeling of Sybil’s arm.  Betty gave one
gulp and didn’t mind.  Somehow she knew that
Sybil had come to put things right for her.
</p>

<p>
“Miss Carey said it would be best for me to come
to-night instead of waiting till to-morrow,” said
Sybil, giving Betty’s slim figure a little hug.  “She
thought that the news I’ve come to bring would give
her nice dreams!”
</p>

<p>
“‘Nice dreams!’”  Rene and Mona had by
this time forgotten the existence of such things as
brushes and combs.  They had turned, like plants
towards the sunlight, to stare through their drawn
curtains at Sybil as she spoke.  Geraldine, though
she was gazing too, was dimpling so much at the
same time, that Betty, catching sight of her face,
guessed suddenly that Gerry must know what
Sybil had come to say.
</p>

<p>
“It was Gerry’s idea,” said Sybil (Gerry stopped
dimpling instantly and began to brush her hair
vigorously for a moment); “Gerry’s altogether.
If she hadn’t thought of it, perhaps I never should.
Not that I was not as disappointed as she was, I
think, that we couldn’t fit Betty into the Daisy
Patrol&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Oh!  It was something about the Guides.  Were
they going to fit her into the Daisies after all?
</p>

<p>
“We’re a full patrol, you see, Betty,” Sybil went
on, speaking in her quiet, pretty voice.  “Each
patrol in our company has eight girls; and there
were thirty-two girls here this term before you
came.  Well, that makes you&mdash;who bring the
numbers up to thirty-three&mdash;a dear little extra
one.”  Sybil stopped.
</p>

<p>
“There’s a ‘Lone Guide’ she could be.  It’s
in the Guiding Book.  We were just telling her,
Sybil,” burst in Mona informatively, “she could
work up alone, and&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Sybil felt the sudden shrinking in Betty’s
form at the mention of the word as the child stood
there under the protection of the head girl’s arm.
Perhaps not.  But, whether or no, there was
suddenly a flash in Sybil’s eye as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
“A ‘Lone Guide,’ Mona!  What an idea!  A
Lone Guide at St. Benedick’s!  With thirty-two
Guides here already, who are only too delighted
to welcome another!  Why, if Betty lived all alone
at the North or South Pole, or away at the Back
o’ Beyond, she <i>might</i> be a Lone Guide, just till she
had a chance to join a company.  But <i>here</i>!  Just
as though any one of us would <i>let</i> Betty work at
Guiding on her lonesome!”
</p>

<p>
The strong, gentle arm felt very protective and
kind.
</p>

<p>
“Sorry, Sybil,” murmured Mona, suddenly
remembering her brush.
</p>

<p>
“It was me that thought of the Lone Guide,”
piped up Rene.  “I was reading about it in the
holidays; Mona only followed on, Sybil.  And it’s
not that we don’t <i>want</i> Betty in the Daisies.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Want</i>!  I should rather think we do want her
when Guides are friends of the whole world.”  Sybil
spoke quite indignantly.  “The Cowslips want
her, and the Foxgloves too, and the Buttercups,
as well as the Daisies&mdash;-in fact, the whole company
wants her.  So she mustn’t <i>think</i> of being a Lone
Guide again!  The only difficulty is&mdash;or rather,
<i>was</i>&mdash;that we wondered which patrol she should
be attached to as a recruit while she works up for
her Tenderfoot badge.”
</p>

<p>
The words were still strange to Betty, but she
didn’t mind now.  She was listening breathlessly
and happily.  “Recruit; Tenderfoot; patrol.”  Well,
Sybil was there now, ready to help, and
already Sybil had promised that she should not be
a Lone Guide!
</p>

<p>
“And then&mdash;” the head girl’s voice broke in
on Betty’s thoughts.  There was quite a joyous
sound in Sybil’s tone, as though she had something
joyous to say&mdash;“it was Gerry who thought of a way.”
</p>

<p>
The eyes of Mona and Rene turned enviously
and wonderingly towards Gerry: Gerry’s eyes were
fixed on Sybil.  Sybil, addressing her remarks to
Betty alone, with her arm still round Betty’s waist,
went on,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“It would be nice, we thought, in so very many
ways for you to be attached to the Daisies.  Gerry
and Mona and Rene, you see, are all Daisies;
and you share their room.  You are nearly the
youngest girl at St. Benedick’s, too, and are likely
to be in the lowest class, of course; and you will
find several Daisies there.  Of course, <i>any</i> girl in
the company would help you&mdash;or they wouldn’t
be worth their salt as Guides&mdash;but it <i>is</i> nice and
friendly to work together with one’s own patrol.
Well, then&mdash;”  Sybil stopped for a moment.
</p>

<p>
“After our meeting to-night,” she went on,
“Gerry stopped to speak to me”&mdash;Sybil gave
Gerry a quick but very friendly smile&mdash;“and she
said that she had thought of a way of linking you
on with the Daisies.  It sounded such a good idea
when I heard it; but, of course, I had to speak to
Miss Carey first.  For she, you see, Betty, is head
of the Guides as well as headmistress of the school.
I went straight to her; and Miss Carey agreed
with Gerry and me that it is a splendid idea.  You,
Betty, are to be the <i>mascot</i> of our patrol!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>There!</i>” shouted Gerry, dancing about like a
dimpled dervish.
</p>

<p>
“A ‘mascot’?” said Betty, smiling but in a
half-bewildered fashion.  Mascots were lucky things,
she knew; but&mdash;  Everybody liked mascots, of
course.  But how could <i>she</i> be one?
</p>

<p>
“Lots of regiments in the war had mascots,”
said Sybil.  “And companies of Guides have them,
too, sometimes.  A patrol mascot is a special pet
of the patrol to which it belongs always.  Not
that a mascot is usually a girl, of course.  I’ve never
heard of a little girl being a mascot before.  That’s
where Gerry’s good idea came in!  Well, Betty,
what do you say to it?”  Sybil gave her a friendly
little shake.
</p>

<p>
“I’d&mdash;simply&mdash;love&mdash;to be&mdash;it,” said Betty,
gulping.  “But what would I have to <i>do</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“‘<i>Do!</i>’  You’ll have to ‘do’ nothing, little
Helter-skelter, except just to ‘love’ being it,”
laughed Sybil.  “That will be enough for to-night
anyhow.  There <i>will</i> be things to do, and plenty
of them; but we’ll all love to explain them to you
one by one.  And, in the meanwhile, I’ve come up
here because Miss Carey wanted you to know about
it to-night.  For we like little new girls to have
nice dreams!”  Sybil laughed outright.  “You
are to be one of the Daisies&mdash;our Daisy mascot.
And every one of us&mdash;you, Mona, and you, Rene,
and Gerry, too, as well as the older Daisies,”&mdash;Sybil
looked round the listening group&mdash;“will feel a
special sort of feeling about Betty, and will try to
explain to her what Guiding really means, and will
try to be extra-specially good Guides just because
of having her.  And there’s not going to be any
more talk about Lone Guides,” said Sybil, getting
up; “nor of loneliness of any kind&mdash;not at
St. Benedick’s.  For you don’t belong to the Daisy
Patrol only, Betty, you belong to the whole company;
and every Guide in it, you know, is a friend
to every other Guide, you see.”
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-041.jpg" alt="Sybil bent down suddenly and kissed Betty.">
<br>
Sybil bent down suddenly and kissed Betty.
</p>

<p>
Sybil bent down suddenly and kissed Betty on
the very spot on her flushed cheek where the big
tear had dried itself up a little while before.
</p>

<p>
“Good-night, little Mascot,” said Sybil.  Then
she waved her hand to the rest of them and was
gone.
</p>

<p>
Betty fell asleep that night feeling happier than
she would half an hour earlier have believed
it possible that she could be so soon.  The
loneliness was gone.  Miss Carey’s promise was coming
true&mdash;she didn’t feel out of things any more in the
very least; and, more than that, she was somehow
quite, quite sure that she never could feel out of
things in the same way again at school.  For her
wish had come true, and she was to be one of the
Daisies!
</p>

<p>
And the rest of the Guides&mdash;but particularly
the Daisies&mdash;were to show her “what to do” all
in good time, so Sybil had said.  And to-night
she had to do nothing, because Sybil had said so,
but just to “love” the idea of it, and to go to
sleep and dream nice dreams.  That had been Miss
Carey’s message to her.
</p>

<p>
So, as she lay there, “peace came dropping slow.”  It
seemed easier, with the quiet atmosphere of the
old house round her, and with the memory of Miss
Carey’s quiet smile, and with the memory of the
feeling still of Sybil’s strong restful arm round her,
to leave even the home worries resting quietly too
in Auntie’s kind, capable hands, without fuss and
fret.
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;do&mdash;hope,” Betty found herself thinking
drowsily, “that Dad’s cocoa&mdash;”  But even that
fear didn’t last long.  She was one of the first in
the dormitory to fall asleep that night.
</p>

<p>
And, as the headmistress had wished, her dreams
were glad, each one.  And the gladder, and the
less lonely perhaps, for the fact that each dream
was a jumble of home things and school things,
of home people and school people, forming somehow
a perfectly natural whole, and fitting in together
in the most happily marvellous way!
</p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE GUIDE CUP
</h3>

<p>
“Bet-ty!” called Gerry.
</p>

<p>
They were friends now.  Their liking for each
other, perhaps, had dated from the very first moment
they had met; but their friendship had begun
after Sybil’s evening visit to the dormitory on the
first night of term.
</p>

<p>
For Gerry had taken up the rôle of protector
that evening in her quick, impulsive way.  There
had been something in the lonely look of Betty,
left standing in the middle of the floor of the Oak
Room as the Guides had all trooped out, which
had appealed to the youngest Guide of the
company.  Though younger in years than the rest,
she was perhaps as understanding in heart as any
of the senior Guides themselves.  It had been the
solitary look of Betty standing alone “under the
clock,” too, among crowds of chatterers, which had
brought Gerry to her side; and that same lonely
look had been responsible for the mascot idea which
had been hatched out of Gerry’s brain, to be hailed
with enthusiasm by the entire company of Guides
next day.
</p>

<p>
Betty had wakened, indeed, to “find herself
famous.”  Everybody had looked at her with
friendly grins as the “new mascot.”  She was
addressed on the subject in a hail-fellow-well-met
fashion by girls who had not seemed to notice her
existence before.
</p>

<p>
“I say, that makes nine, then, for the Daisies.
Hope you will bring them good luck.  Not that
they need it.  They’ve kept the Cup for two years.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s hard work with us; not luck.”  Thus
Sybil, who was passing by, and who spoke in a
business-like tone.  “Not that we’re not glad of
our mascot,” she added, smiling swiftly at Betty.
</p>

<p>
The whole school had been out in the garden
that day between breakfast and classes.  Prefects
moving about talking of school arrangements
together; groups of younger girls still exchanging
holiday reminiscences; Gerry, faithful still to her
companion, sticking, as cicerone, to Betty’s side.
</p>

<p>
“I say, it is fun having you as mascot, you know.
There are such lots of things to show you, specially
now that you’re a Daisy: Guide things.  Not
many out here, though, except, of course, the
gardens.”
</p>

<p>
In another minute the gardens had been reached.
</p>

<p>
The Guide plots occupied the strip of land behind
St. Benedick’s.  In years gone by this part of the
grounds had been laid out as a large lawn; but
the land had been dug over, and divided into five
portions, each of equal size.  A great part of the
digging and the actual making of the gardens had
been done by the Guides themselves, under the
supervision and with the help of the head gardener.
Very gradually the work had been carried out;
but now, several years since the Guide movement
had been adopted as part of the Benedick
curriculum, Betty’s first glimpse of the gardens was
a glimpse that she did not soon forget.
</p>

<p>
The warm days of late spring that year had
hastened the growth of the early summer flowers.
The gardens lay in a sheltered spot of the grounds,
and the wild profusion of their blooming plants&mdash;owing
to the fact that the gardeners had been
absent for a matter of several “good growing”
weeks&mdash;and the reckless beauty of the luxuriant
flower-beds caused city-bred Betty to hold her
breath.  On the other side of the building the
stately garden, with its old-time dignity, through
which she had passed yesterday, was peaceful; <i>this</i>
garden looked joyous&mdash;there was no other word.
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t it lovely?”  Gerry quite agreed.  “That’s
the Daisy plot over there.  We choose flowers, all
of us.  In the War, you know, the beds were used
for vegetable growing mostly; and herbs grew
there too.  I was too little to be here then; but
Sybil told us.  And then, afterwards, Miss Carey
said the girls could show by their gardens how
pleased they were that peace had come.  It’s&mdash;like
cheers and flags still, isn’t it?” finished up Gerry.
</p>

<p>
She was right; the gardens were just like cheers
and flags.  The gardens of youth; just as the gardens
of age and dignity lay on the other side of the
house.  Already great patches of different coloured
wallflowers were scenting the air; great clumps of
pinks, too, were already open.  Dusty-millers and
polyanthuses were clustered round about.  Pansies
of all colours showed their faces; a big lilac-bush
was in full bloom; the red hawthorns were nearly
over; and fruit blossom was making the dwarf
trees planted here and there both pink and white
with bloom.  “We’ve got a gorse bush in ours,”
said Gerry, “because we do so love the smell.
We brought it home from a picnic when it was
small.  It’s small still; but we want to hear the pods
cracking in the sun some day when it’s very hot,
like they do on the moor.  The bees love the
gardens, too,” she finished up thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
So they did; there was no doubt of that.
Although nine o’clock had not struck yet, the bees,
buzzing and humming over the gardens, seemed
to have been marketing for hours.
</p>

<p>
“We always have a huge hedge of sweet-peas
in one of the gardens,” said Gerry.  “Every year.
Each of the patrols has it in turns.  It’s the
Foxgloves’ turn now, so we’ll catch the scent in our
classroom, because the hedge will be just under
our window.  Won’t that be lovely!”  She gave
a little skip of delight.
</p>

<p>
Betty had felt inclined to do the same on that
first morning.  She had never known that school
could give such delights, or that a garden could
give such a happy feeling.  She had never owned
a garden before; but now, together with the rest
of the Daisies, it certainly seemed that she owned
a part of this.  “At least, I suppose that only being
a mascot,” she inquired eagerly, “doesn’t mean
that I don’t count.”
</p>

<p>
“There isn’t any ‘only’ about being a mascot,
I’m certain,” Gerry had told her; “though we
might ask Sybil.  Of course it’s partly your garden
too.  There’s the Cup, though, of course.  I
don’t know about <i>that</i>,” she added, wrinkling up
her forehead as she bent over the bed of pinks.
“I say,” she suddenly broke out, “here’s a snail.
We don’t want him on the pinks, do we?  And I
daresay he likes ferns just as much.  I’m going
to put him over the fence into the wood.  Mona
squashes them, but I think that’s hateful.”
</p>

<p>
“What were you saying about the Cup?”
inquired Betty, eagerly falling to upon a snail
search; “I wish you would tell me.  One of the
other girls said&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-047"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-047.jpg" alt="There, just inside, stood a small silver cup.">
<br>
There, just inside, stood a small silver cup.
</p>

<p>
“‘The Cup!’  Well, it’s just the Guide Cup.  It
belongs to the Daisies this year,” explained Gerry
proudly.  “You’ll see it.  It’s in the Oak Room,
and if you had been watching yesterday you might
have noticed that our patrol was standing just
underneath it when Miss Carey called us all up.
On the wall, on a bracket, that’s where the Cup
stands,” went on Gerry.  “The Daisies lead out
first always this year, because we won it.  Well,
on Midsummer Day Miss Carey will decide again
which patrol has been the best; and whichever
she decides on will call the Cup theirs, and stand
under it in Hall, and file out of Hall first, and take
first place.”  Gerry stopped.
</p>

<p>
“I should like to see it,” said Betty, with sparkling
eyes; “most specially as I’m a Daisy too.”
</p>

<p>
“You can’t till to-night.  We don’t go near
the Oak Room all day.  Unless&mdash;”  Gerry broke
off.  “You can see it through the window <i>now</i>, if
you like.  Come along.  The Oak Room window
looks out this way.  Just across here, between the
Daisy and the Cowslip gardens on this strip of
grass.  (We <i>did</i> grow daffs and snowdrops in the
grass two years ago, but we couldn’t help stepping
on them when we went by, and that was so horrid
that we stopped growing them!)  Here, you <i>can</i>
see!”
</p>

<p>
Betty could see quite plainly.  They had arrived
under one of the big windows of the Oak Room,
and there, just inside, was the little ledge on
which stood a small silver cup.
</p>

<p>
“You could see it better&mdash;you could even touch
it,” said her guide proudly, “if the window were
open.  But all the same&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
All the same Betty feasted her eyes on it as
they stood there in joy and pride.  The Cup was
the possession of her patrol, she thought&mdash;until
Midsummer Day at least!
</p>

<p>
That had happened on the first morning after
her arrival; but a whole week of term had passed
by since then&mdash;a week which had really seemed as
full as a year.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of that first day the new girl
had found herself called into the headmistress’s
room again to answer Miss Carey’s promised inquiry
whether Betty was shaking down happily into
“school ways.”  There had been no doubt, from the
look in the child’s eyes, what her answer would be,
even before she had stammered out the words,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“Oh, <i>yes</i>.  I never guessed&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
No, Betty had never guessed the evening before
that next day she would stand gazing round the
Daisy garden feeling like this.  As she stood on the
same spot a week later, she felt as happy, or
perhaps happier than before.
</p>

<p>
Lessons?  They were hard, perhaps; but then
everybody was patient and understanding.  Miss
Drury and Miss Stewart, Miss Lee and
Mademoiselle&mdash;they all seemed to know when she was
trying, and to be quite satisfied with that.  But
when classes were over life was like a dream;
there was only one “only” at St. Benedick’s,
only one thorn in Betty’s bed of roses&mdash;the absence
of the twins and baby; of anybody, in fact, who
needed her in the same way that she had been always
needed at home!
</p>

<p>
Betty still felt a little choky at times, therefore,
not to have Jan’s bed pulled close to her own; not
to have to play “Little Mother” all day long.
If there had been any “mothering” of any kind
to do at St. Benedick’s, then school would have
been to her a perfect place.  But except for Gerry,
who had begun by protecting Betty herself, and
who certainly did not intend to be “mothered,”
Betty was the youngest girl of all.  Mona and Rene
were each a few months older, and proportionately
proud of the fact; and the Mascot found herself
in much the same position at St. Benedick’s as
that occupied at home by Jan, the twin.
</p>

<p>
She was smiled at by the seniors, and petted a
little.  And though to be “treated like a little one”
was just what she needed, and lovely, too, in a
way, yet Betty wanted to pet some one herself!
If it hadn’t been for the garden her heart would
have had an empty place in it which nothing else
at St. Benedick’s quite knew how to fill.
</p>

<p>
But the Daisy garden was hers&mdash;partly, at least.
Sybil had told her so.  At the first Guide meeting
the patrol leader&mdash;very quiet and business-like,
and altogether unlike the affectionate laughing
girl who had sat on shy Betty’s bed and hugged
her&mdash;had presided over her patrol, and had explained,
after going into details, none of which the Mascot
understood, what Betty’s work would be.
</p>

<p>
“I want Mona and Rene and Gerry to teach you
the Guide promises, and to explain them, Betty.
They will do so as well as they can, and you can all
talk them over together.  Then, on Saturday week,
you may come and repeat them to me.  That will
be enough Guide work for you; though, if you
like, you might begin practising some of the easy
knots.  Perhaps in the garden, you know.”
</p>

<p>
“Sybil,” Gerry had piped up, “Betty was
asking&mdash;you see, she wants to know if she may
garden.  She’s not taking dancing, nor music, nor
singing, nor riding, nor&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“That will do, Gerry,” Sybil stopped her.
</p>

<p>
Betty was taking none of the “extra subjects”
at school.  Auntie and Dad had explained the
reason to her&mdash;it was because of “the expense”;
and Betty had nodded a business-like head at the
time.
</p>

<p>
At St. Benedick’s, however, Miss Carey had put
the matter to her in another way.  “I am very
glad, my dear, that you are to have a quiet term.
You will have plenty of free time on your hands in
which to learn to be happy in quiet ways.”
</p>

<p>
Betty had found, so far, that her steps had always
seemed to lead her gardenwards at those times.
For there was generally a broken stalk to help, or
a flower to water, or the progress of some bee to
follow, or the gradual growth of some small
seedling to wonder at.  All the things in the garden
were smaller than Betty.  Defenceless, too.
Somehow they seemed to need her a little bit in the way
that the children had needed her at home.  She
had looked up eagerly to hear what Sybil would say
in answer to Gerry’s suggestion.
</p>

<p>
“Why, of course she may garden.  Whenever
she likes.  I will go with you myself to-day, Betty,
and show you what you may do.”
</p>

<p>
In Betty’s first week, then, she had grown more
and more in love with the Daisy garden.  All the
“quiet hours,” as Miss Carey had called them, had
been spent there alone.  It was not until the last
day of the week that she suddenly began to wonder
if she really were quite as alone as she had thought.
</p>

<p>
For something had happened.  Once before she
had half-guessed at a “something.”  And again,
to-day, there was “something” going on which
could not exactly be explained!
</p>

<p>
She was trying to explain it to herself, sitting
back on her heels on the grassy strip between the
plots, when suddenly Gerry’s voice broke through
the silence.
</p>

<p>
“Betty,” called Gerry.  “Bet-ty!”
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE FAIRY PIPER
</h3>

<p>
“But there couldn’t be!” said Gerry, staring.
“You see, nobody’s there.”
</p>

<p>
“There was, though,” said Betty.  “Listen, I
truly believe I heard it again.”
</p>

<p>
Both the girls sat back on the sunny patch of
grass between the gardens and held their breath.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  “O-ver the hills and far a-wa-ay!”<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The air of the quaint old song could plainly be
heard, growing fainter and more far-away even as
they listened, but certainly there for all that.
</p>

<p>
“The funny part of it is,” said Betty, “that
somehow I think I’ve heard it before.  Only I
never thought it came from a person, you know,
Gerry.  It seemed the same kind of tune as the
bees somehow&mdash;a sort of out-of-doors sound, and
mixed up with every other sound.”  She stopped,
wondering whether her companion would
understand what she meant.
</p>

<p>
Gerry, however, appeared to take the remark as
a perfectly intelligible one.  She nodded gravely.
</p>

<br>
The pair of them were leaning over the fence.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I know.  Only it couldn’t be, of course;
because it really is a <i>tune</i>.  I wish&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
By this time the pair of them were leaning over
the fence which divided the gardens from the school
wood.
</p>

<p>
“Nobody’s here,” said Gerry.  “You see, it’s
private; and we couldn’t hear sounds from the
road&mdash;it’s too far off.  But the sound did come from
the wood; I heard it too.”
</p>

<p>
“Just as though,” burst in Betty, “it was a
kind of ‘Piper of Dreams’ sound.  Gerry, there’s
a picture in the post-office at home&mdash;framed, you
know, and to sell.  There’s a boy there, sitting
under a tree&mdash;a kind of fairy boy, I think&mdash;playing
a pipe.  And rabbits and birds are round his knees
listening to him, and not minding him.  I’ve
often taken the twins to see it”&mdash;Betty gave a little
gulp of remembrance&mdash;“and some day when I’m
rich I shall buy it for them.  But even then I
shan’t like it any better than I do now, I don’t
think.  Perhaps not so much.  It’s nice not to have
a thing for altogether, but to have to go out and
look at it.”
</p>

<p>
Gerry nodded again.  “But,” she objected,
“this music couldn’t be him&mdash;I mean we couldn’t
have fairy-piper music here, unless&mdash;”  Transfixed
with a sudden idea she gave a little cry.  “If
it came from <i>Witch’s</i> Wood now,” said Gerry.
“<i>That’s</i> supposed to be magic.  But of course it
didn’t; and no <i>witch</i> would ever play fairy music
of course.”
</p>

<p>
“‘Witch’s Wood!’” repeated Betty, staring.
</p>

<p>
“You can ask Rene about it.  Her father is the
doctor here.  She’s only a boarder at Benedick’s
because she wants to be so much.  She knows about
Witch’s Wood; it was she who told Mona and
me.”  Gerry turned from the fence and seized a trowel.
“Let’s go on gardening, Betty, and get the ground
ready for the mignonette seeds, like Sybil said.
We’ll listen while we do it.  It’s funny that I’ve
been to school a year longer than you and never
heard it before till to-day.  And you’ve heard it often.”
</p>

<p>
“I <i>think</i> I have,” corrected Betty.  “Always
when I’ve been alone, I think; or else I would have
been sure to have asked if you and the others were
hearing it too.  To-day, though, you came along
just as I was beginning to wonder about it.
Perhaps if we don’t talk it will come back.”
</p>

<p>
Gardening went on, however, after that without
the interruption that they hoped for.  Every now
and then the girls lifted their heads, but no sound
came from the wood on the other side of the fence
save the faint soughing of the breeze in the branches
and the occasional call of a bird.
</p>

<p>
“Doesn’t anybody ever go in there, Gerry?”
inquired Betty, rather inclined to look upon the
wood as the home of Faery.
</p>

<p>
“Anybody?  Why, of course; we often do.
The senior girls built their huts in there for the
Pioneer badge last summer, and they gave the
whole school tea.  And we fetch primrose plants
for the gardens from the wood&mdash;from where the
wood doesn’t miss them, you know.  We often
go in there, too, on hot days.  But it’s private
except to us.  No one else goes there.”  Gerry
threw back her mop of hair.  “We might get some
foxglove plants for the garden from there later on.
They’d be lovely.”
</p>

<p>
“Wouldn’t they!” agreed Betty.
</p>

<p>
But she spoke half-abstractedly.  Her heart was
filled with another idea.  The sound of the music
and the remembrance of the dream picture in the
little post-office at home had set her own dreams
racing.  Gerry had mentioned Witch’s Wood;
and the name had a splendid mystery about it too.
At the very next chance she would ask Rene to tell
her about it.
</p>

<p>
“What?”  Up in the dormitory that night,
while they brushed their hair, Rene listened rather
incredulously to their tale.  “No, <i>I’ve</i> never heard
it.  It must have been a mistake.  Or else a
trespassing boy.  Though&mdash;”  Rene broke off.
</p>

<p>
“Well?” inquired Gerry, scenting disbelief in
Rene’s voice.
</p>

<p>
“Dad says that the boys <i>don’t</i> trespass in our
wood.  He says we’re lucky.  He says that the
Witch’s Wood being close by is more help to the
school wood than a hundred ‘Trespassers will be
Prosecuted’ boards,” finished up the doctor’s
daughter.
</p>

<p>
“But <i>our</i> wood’s not Witch’s Wood,” broke in
Gerry.
</p>

<p>
“Of course it’s not.  But they’re close; there’s
only a broken-down fence between.  So I suppose
the boys think the witch might lean over the palings
and catch them,” Rene laughed.
</p>

<p>
“I wish you’d tell me about Witch’s Wood,”
broke in Betty eagerly.  “It’s such a story-book
name, and so thrilly.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s not so thrilly as it sounds, then.”  Rene’s
tone sounded superior.  “It’s absolutely ordinary.
And it’s only private because the owner died abroad
years ago and his estate went into Chancery, and
the village people got ideas about the wood because
of the haunted cottage in the middle.  They <i>say</i>
that it’s haunted anyhow.  They say that it’s a
witch’s cottage, and that it gave the name to the
wood.  But Dad says it ought to be spelt Wych’s
Wood, and that it’s because of the wych elms that
it’s got its name.  And he’s sure to be right.”
</p>

<p>
“Besides,” said Mona severely, breaking in,
“we’re Guides.  And Guides don’t believe in
ghosts.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t either.  Oh, do tell everything about
the witch’s cottage, though, Rene,” begged Betty.
</p>

<p>
“It’s there.  And nobody goes into the wood, so
nobody goes near it.  A lawyer came down from
London once and looked at it.  Dad says it couldn’t
possibly be lived in.  That’s all.”
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t “all” to Betty, though.  She had
made up so many fairy stories for Jan and Jack
in the past that she had grown used to weaving
wonderful fancies out of very little material by
dint of a great deal of imagination.  Here, with
Witch’s Wood as a background, and with the
memory of the “fairy music” still echoing in her
mind in spite of the superior looks of Rene and
Mona, Betty felt herself equipped with material
for a whole host of tales.  There was no one to tell
them to unfortunately, though; and her “supposings”
met with a cold reception from two of the
dormitory at least.
</p>

<p>
“You couldn’t have heard it.  And Guides don’t
believe in ghosts,” repeated Mona.
</p>

<p>
“Nor do I.  Ghosts are silly and frightening,”
burst out Betty impatiently.  “I never said a word
about them.  Witches are quite different; they
might be quite nice, only rather cross on top with
unhappiness.  And I am sure some Guides <i>must</i>
believe in fairies anyway!”
</p>

<p>
But the others appeared to consider that the
Mascot was not qualified to express such definite
opinions.  Only Gerry stood up for her friend.
</p>

<p>
“Truly, Mona, I don’t see why not either.
Betty, you’d better ask Sybil&mdash;when you go to
repeat the promises, you know.  Oh, I say, that
reminds me: she’ll never know them unless we
help her now.”
</p>

<p>
The learning of the Guide promises had been a
labour on which the whole dormitory had employed
itself, anxious that the Mascot should be a credit
to the patrol.  By the end of her second week
Betty was word perfect at least.  She had learned
to repeat that a Guide’s honour is to be trusted;
that a Guide is loyal; that she is a friend of all,
and so on: there were ten commandments in the
law.  Betty, studiously repeating them at odd
moments, found herself wondering if she ever would
be good enough to be elected a real Guide; whether
she could ever be good enough to make the Guide’s
promise!  The rest of the guide work which Sybil
had set her&mdash;the tying and untying of sundry
boot-lace ends, under the direction of Mona on the lawn
in the grounds, into knots&mdash;was just like play.
There had been a Guiding practice too already;
for the younger Guides, under the direction of
Eve&mdash;Sybil’s second in the patrol&mdash;had to study some
of the woodcraft signs, and how to track and trail.
That, so Betty decided, had also been play.
</p>

<p>
But the promises and the law felt different&mdash;not
play at all.  And somehow, though she
couldn’t explain it, the salute seemed to “come
in between.”
</p>

<p>
“A kind of bridge the salute is.  You feel sort
of responsible when you salute, though it’s fun too.
But the promises and the law <i>couldn’t</i> be fun,” was
her summing up to Sybil on the Saturday, a fortnight
after her arrival, when the head of the patrol
had sent for the newest recruit.
</p>

<p>
“A bridge, is it?  Well, perhaps,” agreed Sybil,
smiling at the recruit.  “Well, you can say the
law through as well as any one of us, I think.  But
being word perfect, you know, is just the very
beginning.  Now let me see the reef-line knot.  And
you have been doing some gardening, I know.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Sybil,” Betty remembered suddenly, “may
Guides believe in fairies?”
</p>

<p>
Sybil thought they certainly might, and that
many of them did, after screwing up her brows a
little to deliberate.  She listened, too, to the tale
of the fairy music in much more sympathetic a
manner than had Rene and Mona.  “I have never
heard it,” she said, “but I should not like to say
you made a mistake.  Besides, you say that Gerry
heard it too?”
</p>

<p>
“Once, when she came up suddenly,” said
Betty, with eyes glistening.  “But till then I’d
always been alone, you know.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, next time I am gardening alone I shall
listen for it too,” said the head of the patrol soberly.
“But even if you should find out that it is not
fairies who make it, that need not disappoint you,
need it?  Tell me if you hear it again, though.”  Sybil
stopped short and coloured a little before she
went on.  “Some things,” she said (shyly, Betty
thought, if a head girl <i>could</i> feel shy), “are loveliest
somehow if one keeps them secret.  Like fairy
music, perhaps, and&mdash;oh, other things that
sometimes happen when one is alone.  It somehow
takes the bloom off the loveliness to talk about
them.”  Sybil stopped.  “Miss Carey said something like
that in the Oak Room last year,” said Sybil; “but
I am afraid I have not made it plain enough for you
to understand.”
</p>

<p>
Betty retreated into the garden feeling more
anxious than ever, however, that the “Piper of
Dreams” should play.  The rest of the girls were
at sketching class, away at the other end of the
grounds under the charge of the art mistress; she
herself was free for one of her quiet hours.  She
was still thinking of what Sybil had said as she
made her way to the Daisy plot and up beyond
it to the fence which divided the gardens from the
school wood, and stood there, leaning over and
listening.
</p>

<p>
“Just in case&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
There was no sound; but suddenly her eyes fell
on something bright lying at her feet, and she bent
down.  A peacock’s feather lay there.  It seemed
to have been pushed through an opening in the
fence, and lay on the blade of the spade which she
had left there that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
“I believe it’s a present to <i>me</i>!” said Betty,
staring.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
IN WITCH’S WOOD
</h3>

<p>
She stood perfectly still and gazed at the feather
for a moment.  Then she leaned over the fence to
see if there was anything else to be seen.
</p>

<p>
“If there was a sign of any one&mdash;” said Betty
aloud, as she broke off suddenly and stood still
by the fence trying to think out the idea that had
come to her.  “Why,” she went on, “I said the
word ‘sign,’ and I never realized that it’s a Guide
word.  Eve was talking about ‘sign’ at the Guiding
lesson.  She was showing us how to track snails
by the ‘sign’ of their silvery trails in the garden.
She told me to remember the story of Hop o’ my
Thumb, too, and his ‘sign’ that he laid down so
that his brothers should find their way home.
And one minute ago I was saying there might be
‘sign’ here.  I know what I shall do!”
</p>

<p>
She did it, too.  Why not?  She was over the
fence at once.  After all, she had an hour to spare,
and the girls had told her that the school wood was
not forbidden.  They had said that they often went
there, and although Betty herself had entered
into her third week at St. Benedick’s without as
yet visiting the wood herself, yet that was only
because there had been so many other things to do.
</p>

<p>
Now the moment had come, however.  She
clambered over the fence and reached the other
side, intent on discovering whether there really
was a “piper of dreams.”
</p>

<p>
The tracking of “sign” is not easy for a
beginner&mdash;especially alone and in the deepness of a wood.
In the Guiding lesson over which Eve had presided
the older girl had helped the younger ones more
than Betty had realized until she started off on
this quest of her own.  Also being on the tiptoe
of excitement, and forgetting to “hasten slowly,”
she was inclined to jump to conclusions too readily.
She took a lightning glance round.
</p>

<p>
“If somebody’s been, where did they come from?
Have they left any tracks?  If so, I’ve got to find
them.  That’s the sort of thing Eve would say,”
she told herself.  Then she stood still for a moment,
and certainly noticed that close under the fence,
in the shadow of a tree trunk, there was a heap of
leaves which had recently been disturbed.
</p>

<p>
This might be “sign,” she thought eagerly.
The leaves seemed pressed down, as though some
one might have been crouching there&mdash;a wild
thing of the wood, perhaps.  Betty was off and
away, taking her path through the trees.
</p>

<p>
Once among them, however, she lost all trace
of more “sign.”  The wood seemed bigger, too,
than she had expected when once she had got beyond
the first beeches past a clearing which was carpeted
with beech mast, and then to a grove of trees beyond.
As the others said, the school wood seemed to have
no approach from the road at all.  Behind her,
as she knew, were the school grounds; but, if she
had not known they were so close, she would have
felt herself very far indeed from any human
habitation in the stillness of the wood.
</p>

<p>
For overhead the trees seemed sighing as though
they held secrets that they never meant to tell
except in a language of their own which no one but
themselves could ever understand.  Underfoot the
dry leaves crackled, and occasionally a bird, taking
the rustling path itself, caused Betty to look round
hopefully.
</p>

<p>
“I never knew before that birds’ steps could
sound so loud in a wood,” thought she.  “That’s
three times I’ve turned round, and it’s always been
a thrush pecking under the leaves.  Well, that’s
something about birds, I suppose, that I’ve learned
at first-hand, like Eve told us to try to do in Guide
lesson.  I shall tell her next time.”
</p>

<p>
But Betty was beginning to feel rather disappointed,
for she had found out absolutely nothing
to help her in her quest.  “I’ve been too ‘helter-skelter,’
that’s what Sybil would say,” she remarked
to herself.  “Well, I’d better go back and try
again to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
But going back was not quite so simple a course
as she had expected.  She had forgotten to notice
any distinguishing features on any of the trees,
and now they all seemed alike.
</p>

<p>
“Here’s a hurdle sort of thing.  Did I pass it
before?” she asked herself.  “And that tree; it
looks familiar somehow.  If I only knew which way
St. Benedick’s lies!  The rest of the Guides have
compasses, and Gerry said they made it much easier
to find one’s way.  I shall ask her to-morrow.  But
now I don’t know exactly where I am.”  She
turned and walked on.  “I rather think, if I pass
these trees, that I see that clearing-place beginning
again just beyond.”
</p>

<p>
She was not in the least nervous, for, after all,
the school must be very near.  The adventure was
“thrilly,” she decided.  It was not until the next
trees had been passed, and the “clearing-place”
reached, that Betty suddenly stood still and stared.
</p>

<p>
“Why!” she said.
</p>

<p>
For this was not the bare patch between the
trees which she had passed before&mdash;just beyond
the beeches which separated it from St. Benedick’s.
This was a clearing, certainly, but quite a different
one.  The ground was studded with clumps of
bracken and with tussocks of blue-bells; but
there was something else in the clearing too.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p63"></a>
A cottage!  A little tumble-down desolate cottage!
And at the sight of it Betty stood perfectly
still, staring with eyes filled with wonder.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve come wrong!  It’s the witch’s cottage,”
she said.  “Oh, you <i>poor</i> thing!”
</p>

<p>
For if ever a tiny forsaken dwelling was in need
of Betty’s motherly ministrations, this cottage
certainly seemed that one.  The fact that it was
presumably “haunted,” and shunned by the villagers
in consequence; the fact that a witch might
still have her abode there; even the fact that she
herself must certainly be considered by the law in
the light of a trespasser, were forgotten as she
gazed.
</p>

<p>
“I must be in Witch’s Wood,” she said to herself.
“Rene said it was close; but I didn’t understand
that I could come into it without knowing.
A fence, she said.  Well, that hurdle thing must
have been part of a broken-down old fence.  I’ve
come a good way too.”
</p>

<p>
But she was hurrying forward all the same as she
spoke.  For she couldn’t do anything else.  She could
not turn back until she had “done something” for
the little place which looked so desperately in need
of mothering.  Its roof was broken, if a roof the
cottage could still be said to possess.  Its door
seemed to flap open mournfully.  Its windows were
cracked and broken.  Mosses and lichens grew on its
walls.  Desolation seemed to be its very name.
Betty broke into a run, therefore; then, as she
reached its step, she hesitated before she entered.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose I may!  Oh, I must!  No one lives
here.  Rene said so.”  In she went.
</p>

<p>
A two-roomed little one-storied cottage.  Its
two rooms opened into each other, and the door
between gaped wide.  As Betty entered the first
room she could survey the entire house.
</p>

<p>
Was it a witch’s cottage? she asked herself suddenly,
as she stood there staring.  <i>Could</i> it be, after
all?
</p>

<p>
For, absolutely empty of furnishings as it
certainly was, with its paper peeling miserably from
its walls; with damp running down them; with
insects holding carnival in its corners; with its
shutters flapping by rusty hinges outside its broken
panes&mdash;yet&mdash;yet, strange and wonderful to say,
arranged in a primitive design on the dirty floor
of the room, lay flowers!  Fresh and fragrant,
in a quaint, almost elfin-like pattern.  Wild
hyacinths, late primroses, anemones, stars of
Bethlehem&mdash;the floor of the room seemed carpeted with
them as though some quaint idea of design had
been at the back of some one’s mind.  For “some
one” must have done it&mdash;a “some one,” Betty
was certain, who must be of fairy origin.
</p>

<p>
“I <i>am</i> trespassing,” she said suddenly out loud.
And she turned and found herself hurrying away,
though she couldn’t have expressed the reason of
her flight in words.  “Some one is looking after
it.  It isn’t so miserable as it looks outside,” she
told herself, as she ran with her heart thumping.
“It must be a fairy house.”
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-065"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-065.jpg" alt="Was it a witch’s cottage?">
<br>
Was it a witch’s cottage?
</p>

<p>
But as her heart stopped thumping she began
to try to think things out more common-sensibly.
“I’m thirteen,” said Betty to herself; “and
though Sybil does say that fairies aren’t babyish
to believe in, yet I do know that to find a cottage
like that is absolutely queer.  Jan and Jack
would believe in it, but I hardly can.  Still it
was there; and the wood is called Witch’s Wood
by everybody.  And Rene says that the villagers
are afraid of it.  I could never be <i>afraid</i> of
whoever it is who puts those flowers there.  Not that
it can be haunted&mdash;”  She broke off.  “Well,
now, I simply <i>must</i> find my way out,” she said,
trying to banish the mystery of the cottage from her
mind.
</p>

<p>
It was a difficult business, but she managed
at last.  After turning and twisting through the
trees of Witch’s Wood, she came suddenly at last
within sight and sound of the everyday humdrum
world again.
</p>

<p>
“I’m evidently some way from St. Benedick’s,”
she thought, “but I’m coming out at last.  I can
see a road; and when I get to the fence, any one I
meet will show me the way.  Why, what’s that?”
</p>

<p>
For she had reached the fence now, and voices
were plainly audible from the road below.  Lusty
laughter and shoutings; evidently a crowd of
village urchins were playing there.  Betty made up
her mind to wait until they had passed by.  She
did not wish to make a descent from Witch’s Wood
until the coast was clear of them.  She peeped
through the broken palings and then suddenly
changed her mind.
</p>

<p>
For a whole crowd of good-for-nothing small
boys had collected, and were circling round one of
their number who seemed to Betty, from her
hiding-place, the queerest figure on which she had ever
set eyes.  He was a tall boy of perhaps her own
age, but tattered and torn as she had never seen a
boy before; his garments seemed quaint, too, almost
ludicrous, and he seemed trying, as he stood there,
to hold his own unaided against the jeering,
cat-calling throng.
</p>

<p>
At the sight Betty’s eyes blazed, and she was
over the fence like a flash.  “Let him alone this
instant,” called she to the amazed and terrified
group.
</p>

<p>
For terrified they were at the sight of her,
appearing as she did over the fence of Witch’s Wood.
In one instant, to a boy, the crowd had dispersed
in the opposite direction, leaving their victim alone.
</p>

<p>
The stranger might have been aged fourteen, but
his clothes were evidently intended for a younger
boy by far, and they had been patched and mended
so thoroughly, and with such disregard for
colour-matching, that he seemed to possess a piebald
appearance.  His head was covered, too, with a
shock of the roughest hair Betty had ever seen;
and by the expression of his face it was plain that
he was simple-minded.  His cheek was cut and
bleeding too; but he seemed to take little notice
of his hurts.  Instead, he made straight for Betty,
shaking his fist and pointing to the wood.
</p>

<p>
“You munna go nigh Witch’s Wood.  You munna.
You munna go nigh it.  There’s witches in it, and
ghostses, and spookses; you munna go nigh it.”  He
shook and shivered as he pointed there.
</p>

<p>
“It’s all right,” said Betty in her motherly
tone.  “Don’t worry.  I lost my way; but I
shan’t go there again.  If you will tell me where
there is a stream, I’d like to wash that cut, though,
on your cheek.”
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
BETTY KEEPS A SECRET
</h3>

<p>
“I say,” remarked the inhabitants of Dormitory
Three in chorus.
</p>

<p>
Not that they were assembled in the dormitory,
but “hasten slowly” time was just over on the
afternoon of the day following Betty’s adventure
in the wood.
</p>

<p>
“Hasten slowly” time occurred every day, and
occupied the hour immediately following each
midday meal.  The name had originated after
the utterance of an apt remark by one of the
middle school girls who had discovered that the
hour’s rest enforced by rule at St. Benedick’s was
not waste of valuable time after all, but tended
rather, in the end, to help towards a fuller use of
energy.  To new pupils hailing from other and
perhaps more “go-ahead” schools it was something
of a surprise to find that from two o’clock
to three every one of the middle and junior girls
was required to endure or enjoy an hour’s <i>dolce
far niente</i>&mdash;stretched out in summer time on the
lawns, and in winter time on rugs in the Oak Hall.
</p>

<p>
Of all the strange ways of school Betty had found
this one, at first, the hardest to bear.  Lying
perfectly still on a sunny lawn during the first two
afternoons her thoughts had travelled homewards
at an alarming pace.  She had longed to be up
and “doing something.”  And to know that sixty
minutes of this home-sick time was ahead of her
daily until the end of term seemed more than she
could bear.  On the third day, however, to her
vast surprise, she had fallen asleep in the middle
of a torturing thought as to whether Auntie had
remembered to get those shoes of Jan’s both soled
and heeled, and had wakened in amazement to
find Gerry at her side while the church clock struck
three.  But after that experience the spell had been
broken somehow; Betty had grown to look forward
to the “hasten slowly” hour as one of the
most restful in her restful days.
</p>

<p>
It was a good time to repeat the Guide law and
the promises, sleepily and more sleepily until they
almost changed to dreams.  It was a good time
to think thoughts that, otherwise, the business of
the day might have ruled out altogether.  Betty
thought of the fairy piper music sometimes in this
hour; and remembered what Sybil had said, and
wondered.  On this particular afternoon she had
been thinking curiously, quietly, and almost lovingly
of her strange secret adventure in the witch’s cottage.
</p>

<p>
And she had decided&mdash;had quite decided&mdash;that
the adventure there was one of the things Sybil
had meant.  “Some things are loveliest when they
are kept secret,” the head girl had said.  “Things
that sometimes happen when one is alone.  It
takes the bloom off them to talk of them.”  Betty
remembered every word, though she had not
understood at the time what the words could mean.
Now she was beginning to understand, though;
so she told herself.  For if she were to tell any one,
the telling, somehow, would spoil her
adventure-memory.  That secret of the witch’s
cottage&mdash;which had seemed so desolate outside, but which,
inside, had been beautiful, cared for by some
strange, mysterious magic&mdash;was her own.  Perhaps
the piper of dreams was connected with it.
Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Betty was still drowsily and happily “perhapsing”
on the subject under the shade of one of the
great old trees in the grounds, when the prefect
whose duty that afternoon it was to preside over
the juniors’ quiet hour gave the signal for them
to rise.
</p>

<p>
“I say, Betty, tell us.  We’ve not had a single
chance to ask you about yesterday afternoon till
now.  You never said a word about it in the
dormitory; but the other girls know.  There’s plenty
of time while we get our letter-writing things.
You can even tell us while we write them.  Miss
Drury says we can write letters under the trees
this afternoon because it’s too hot indoors.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not going to tell <i>anything</i> while I write
letters,” said Betty with startled conviction.
Sunday afternoons were packed full, as she rightly
considered, since there were five anxious, loving
folk at home to be reassured concerning her health
and happiness, and regaled with tit-bits of weekly
information.  “And besides,” she continued
hurriedly, “there’s nothing to tell.”
</p>

<p>
“There is.”  Mona and Rene were convinced on
that point.  “About the boy whose face you were
patching up when Drina and Maud came along.
They said it showed you’d make a good Guide.
And however came you to be in the road at
all?” finished up Mona.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-071"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-071.jpg" alt="And that Robby-boy saw me climbing out.">
<br>
“And that Robby-boy saw me climbing out.”
</p>

<p>
“Anybody in the world, not only Guides,”
said Betty with rising colour, “would help a boy
with a cut cheek, I should trust and hope&mdash;especially
when he was frightened, and seeing that
he was sort of queer, you know.  When Drina and
Maud came along, though, it was <i>they</i> who helped
him more than me.”
</p>

<p>
“They know First Aid, being senior Guides, of
course,” put in Mona informatively.  “And Drina
anyway, being head of the Foxgloves, has heaps
of badges.  She would know simply <i>anything</i>!
It happens that she knew who the boy was.  It was
just Robby&mdash;old Granny Beaver’s boy.  I know
him too, quite well; they call him a ‘natural.’  We
often get hot water from that cottage in the
holidays when we go for picnics at home.”
</p>

<p>
“He was dreadfully frightened, whoever he was,”
said Betty again; “but I think he was brave too.”
</p>

<p>
“Brave <i>and</i> frightened?” said Rene.  “Well,
anyway Drina told Eve&mdash;for I heard her&mdash;that
when they came up you were mending his cheek;
and he was crying.”
</p>

<p>
“It wasn’t that kind of bravery I meant.”  But
Betty stuck to her point.  “He did cry, I know.
He was crying, too, when the boys were teasing
him.  But&mdash;well, I’d got into Witch’s Wood by
mistake, you see,” she continued hurriedly.  “I’ve
explained to Drina, and she understands how.
And that Robby-boy saw me climbing out.  The
other boys ran off because they were frightened
of me&mdash;thinking I was the witch, I suppose,” went
on Betty, “and never looked back.  But he&mdash;well,
he might have run, too, I suppose; but he didn’t.
He was <i>brave</i>, like I said.  He even forgot his cuts
and things and stopped crying, and kept on telling
me how spooky and frightening and all that the
wood is.  And he was shaking with fright himself
all the time.  I could see it.  And <i>yet</i> he went on.”
</p>

<p>
By the emphasis of her utterance her convictions
carried weight.  The others nodded.
</p>

<p>
“Drina said that,” agreed Mona.  “She said
he kept begging you not to go back and get spooked
by the witch.  Of course he’s sort of simple; and
I expect his granny frightened him about it when
he was little.  She’s rather hateful.  Perhaps he
felt grateful to you for taking his part and wanted
to pay you back.  Didn’t he follow you home?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, poor darling,” said Betty in her most
motherly tone&mdash;“and simply wouldn’t go, and
wouldn’t go.  And even when he <i>did</i> go he kept
saying that he’d do something for me some day.
That’s all,” finished up Betty, as, cumbered with
a writing pad and two sharp pencils, she turned
lawnwards again.  “It wasn’t an adventure,
except, of course&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
She stopped.
</p>

<p>
Except the part of the afternoon when she had
found the witch’s cottage.  But she had decided
to say nothing about that.  Not to Mona and
Rene; not even to Gerry; no, and not even in
the weekly letter home.  It was to be her own
secret “with all the lovely bloom left on,” as Sybil
had advised.
</p>

<p>
Her experience in the wood, however, even
though a part of it was known only to herself, came
into active consideration at the next meeting of
the senior Guides.
</p>

<p>
“It just shows how useful it is for the juniors
to understand tracking,” remarked Sybil.  “A
less sensible girl than Betty Carlyle might have got
right into the heart of the wood.  And perhaps,
if the others had been telling her silly tales, she
would have been more frightened than she was.
There’s the cottage there, you see, I believe, still.
That cottage which is supposed to contain a ghost.”
</p>

<p>
“A cottage, Sybil?”  Some of the seniors
were not even aware of its existence.
</p>

<p>
“Oh yes; quite a village story.  And Rene,
since she lives in the district, knows about it.  No
Guide believes in ghosts, naturally; but Betty is
only such a raw recruit, and there is a cottage there.
It’s out of bounds, of course, and lies right in the
middle of the wood, I believe; and, our directions
being to keep on this side of the broken paling, it’s
out of bounds to us.  But Betty knew nothing
about that apparently, and went straight on.”
</p>

<p>
“She said nothing about any cottage, however,”
put in Drina.  “When Maud and I found her
patching up the boy she was at her most
energetic&mdash;apparently comforting him on account of his own
fears of the wood, and assuring him that she was
not a witch herself!  He had been telling her his
fears; that’s what Maud and I thought.”
</p>

<p>
“But all the same,” Sybil spoke up, “I am
going to make some extra practice time for all the
junior Daisies.  Betty says that she tried to follow
‘sign,’&mdash;evidently acting on Eve’s instructions&mdash;but
that she could not find any!  Well, they shall
have a tracking practice next week.”
</p>

<p>
“You mean to keep the Cup next year, then, Sybil!”
</p>

<p>
“Let the best patrol win, of course; but I mean
ours to be the best if dogged will do it,” said the
head of the school.
</p>

<p>
The junior Daisies, therefore, on the following
Friday afternoon were thrilled and enthralled at
the appearance of a special notice on the notice-board
of their patrol.  There would be, it appeared,
an expedition on the following Saturday week,
captained by the head.  All Daisies were expected
to attend, and&mdash;before the practice&mdash;they were
requested to “make themselves as ready as
possible” for the afternoon’s lesson, which would, it
appeared, include exercise in spooring and tracking.
</p>

<p>
“But what can <i>I</i> do?” inquired Betty rather
helplessly in the dormitory that night.  For her
recent efforts to extricate herself from the wood
by means of applying the principles laid down by
Eve had met with scant success.  And she was
terribly anxious not to disgrace the patrol to which
she was attached.
</p>

<p>
“Sybil won’t expect you to know <i>anything</i>.
<i>We’re</i> going to read up,” informed Mona and Rene.
</p>

<p>
But to the Mascot the blue Guide book was as
yet forbidden ground.  Betty would in feverish
eagerness, as Sybil probably guessed, have read
and re-read the blue book through, and in trying
to work out every principle at one and the same
time have failed miserably.  “Nothing was to be
gained by snatching,” as Miss Carey had said on
the first night.  Betty’s knowledge must come by
slow degrees.
</p>

<p>
“I tell you what,” said Gerry, noticing her friend’s
unhappy face, “we’ll both practise together.
There’s a week before the expedition, and you’ll
learn some things anyway by then.  There’s a
sandy place in the grounds here where we’ve worked
at making footprints, and we’ll start on that.
Different sized ones, and standing still and running
ones, you know.”
</p>

<p>
Gerry dimpled in a friendly way.
</p>

<p>
This sounded delicious to the Mascot; in spite of
the rather superior looks of Mona and Rene, Betty’s
eyes danced at the thought.  If she had known
how very real and unexpectedly thrilling the
tracking expedition at the end of the week would turn
out to be, it is likely that she would not have longed
for it quite as whole-heartedly and delightedly as
she did.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
LOST!&mdash;THE CUP!
</h3>

<p>
Betty was wrought up to a fever of energy.
</p>

<p>
She and Gerry were gardening; but for once
the gardens seemed tame.  With the idea at the
back of her mind of the tracking expedition to take
place in less than a week’s time, the Mascot felt
anxious to be up and doing instantly.  Gerry had
come out for half an hour’s gardening, but Betty
was firmly of opinion that the said half-hour could
be put to a better use.
</p>

<p>
“Gerry, do you think we could practise steps
in that sandy place&mdash;like you said last night?”
</p>

<p>
“Now?”  Gerry looked up from a serious
investigation of some small Shirley poppy seedlings.
“Oh, I don’t know.  We could do that later,
perhaps.  But Nancy was saying to Eve at breakfast
that she had seen three slugs in the pink clump.
And these poppies are next door to the pinks.
Slugs are awful if they start eating up seedlings,
and these poppies are so lovely when they’re
out.”  Gerry returned to her work.
</p>

<p>
“But&mdash;”  Betty strove hard to be patient as she
explained&mdash;“I do so badly want to practise.  Not
being allowed to read the blue book yet, you see,
I’m not sure, till you explain, exactly how to start.”
</p>

<p>
“All right, then,” returned Gerry.  “We’ll put
in ten minutes at the end of my gardening time.
But not any more, I’m afraid.  You see, there’s
the Cup.  We don’t want to lose it.”
</p>

<p>
“Lose the Cup!” cried Betty indignantly.  “As
though I wasn’t just as awfully anxious as
anybody.”  For Gerry’s speech seemed to her
singularly inopportune.  Her request had been uttered
just because she felt so tremendously keen, so she
told herself, not to shame the Daisies by her
ignorance.  To please Sybil, and not to disgrace her
patrol, she must&mdash;even if she were only a raw
recruit&mdash;have a few ideas in her mind as to how to track
and spoor before next Saturday came round.
</p>

<p>
“Well.”  Gerry sat down on her heels and looked
at her.  “I didn’t mean anything horrid.  I meant
that we might lose it, you see, if&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“If what?” asked Betty.
</p>

<p>
“It’s only ours till Midsummer Day,” said
Gerry slowly, growing a little pink.  “Then we
might easily lose it if&mdash;”  She spoke rather soberly,
but on seeing the perturbed expression on her
friend’s face she broke off.  “Let’s start the
spooring practice now, then,” she said; “and then you
can go on practising by yourself, and I’ll come back
and do gardening afterwards.”  She rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
“I’d rather&mdash;rather anything happened,” said
Betty vigorously, joining her friend as they walked
down the grassy slope between the gardens, “than
that we should lose the Cup.  So why&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Gerry tried to explain why.  “We’ve tried to be
the best patrol all this year, and we <i>are</i> likely to keep
it,” she said, “unless something dreadful happens.
We all know that, and the other patrols know it
too.  We’re top in badges, you see; and we got
top marks at the display last term.  And those
things count.  Miss Carey gives the decision, of
course, at the end, though.  And even if we <i>had</i>
got best marks, and best badges, and best reports,
yet we shouldn’t deserve it&mdash;at least I’m sure Miss
Carey would say so, and it would be true&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“If what?” said Betty for the third time.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I’m trying to say it.  If just because
we were near it we got slack about little things
like slugs,” finished up Gerry thankfully.  “There,
that’s what I mean.  They’re big things, really,
even though they’re little; because they’d mean
that we <i>were</i> slack.  So&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Betty nodded.  She did see.  “Let’s go back
and garden, then, instead of tracking,” suggested
she resignedly.
</p>

<p>
“No, I don’t believe Sybil would tell us to.
Not a bit.  Of course you want to know about
spooring.  It’s only that it’s sort of fussy and not
Benedicky to race off to something else when you’ve
got started on a job.”  Gerry was rather red as she
spoke.  “Here’s the sandy patch,” she added with
relief, “behind these bushes.  A bird’s been
walking on it already.  See?&mdash;the mark of his
claws, I mean.  Well, we’ll practise our own now,
and then you will see the difference.”
</p>

<p>
The occupation began.
</p>

<p>
But all the time Gerry was coaching her in the
earliest rudiments of spooring, Betty’s face wore
an exceptionally solemn look.  Her friend had been
more “Guidy” than herself, as she expressed it.
She was still “helter-skelter,” as Sybil had called
her on the first night, and though she was
beginning to grasp the true meaning underlying the
school motto, and to come under the influence of
the quiet, steady atmosphere of St. Benedick’s,
yet, in her well-meaning anxiety to be up and doing,
Betty seemed sometimes to frustrate her own
efforts after all.
</p>

<p>
It had been like that at home sometimes.  She
had not yet forgotten the results of a certain day’s
zeal, when she had raced busily into her father’s
patients’ waiting-room to pacify the screaming
baby of a poor woman patient, and had thus brought
the germ of scarlet fever upon herself and even
upon the luckless twins.  Dad had spoken no word
of blame; but Ann, the general servant, who had
had so many extra duties thrust upon her by the
results of Betty’s act of energy, had had her say.
Also, as Betty knew, it was “the scarlet fever”
which had caused Dad’s appeal to Auntie, who was
governessing in India, to come home and help them.
There had been other well-meant actions, too,
which had come to naught.
</p>

<p>
Here at school, of course, the whole scheme of
things had been so utterly new to Betty until recently
that her energies had remained under control.
But she <i>had</i> trespassed into Witch’s Wood
unthinkingly; and to-day Eve <i>had</i> informed her that
her efforts in the gardening direction were too
vigorous and forceful, and must be confined within
certain limits laid down by the senior Guides.
Also, to-day, Gerry had told her not to fuss.
</p>

<p>
“I tell you what,” continued Gerry, suddenly
breaking in on her thoughts&mdash;“you know quite
enough now to go on alone.  Practise running and
then walking, and compare the marks you leave.
And then think out other things to do for yourself.
I’m going back to those slugs now; you don’t mind,
do you?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Betty thoughtfully.  “And I’ll
come back presently myself and do slugs too.”
</p>

<p>
But when at last, after an interval of about
half an hour, Betty did return, it was to find that
Gerry’s gardening time was over and her friend
gone.  The slugs, too, seemed gone, owing to
Gerry’s careful search, and Betty, being now
restricted by Eve in her activities, found herself
with time on her hands and to spare.
</p>

<p>
“I’d rather do anything than lose the Cup on
Midsummer Day,” she said half-aloud, leaning over
the fence.
</p>

<p>
The mere thought of the Cup caused an expedition
to look at it through the window of the Oak
Room, where, on the first day of term, she had first
caught sight of it.  She had peeped at it nearly
every day since then during prayers in the morning.
She had been entrusted with the rubbing-up
of the trophy, too, under Sybil’s direction, every
Saturday when the older Guides were at definite
Guide work, and the rubbing-up of the Cup was
perhaps the most cherished of the Mascot’s jobs.
As she peered through the Oak Room window a
sudden idea struck her.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll clean it now,” declared Betty.  “On
Saturday we’ll be tracking at Guide time, and it
won’t get done.  I saw Sybil look up at it to-day
after roll-call as though she was wondering if it
looked quite shiny enough.  Well, it <i>shall</i> be.  I
know where the chamois is, and I can do it out here.
I cleaned it in the garden last week at Guiding time
while the rest were doing First Aid bandaging.”
</p>

<p>
It seemed a splendid way of using up time and
superfluous energy, for the garden seemed in no
need of mothering, and Betty’s whole heart was
centred just then in the Cup itself.  She sat there,
lost to the world of everything, on the strip of grass
between the gardens, polishing away.
</p>

<p>
“Sybil said I did it pretty well last time.  Well,
I’ll do it better now,” remarked she.  “I’d not lose
you for anything!”  She gave it a little motherly
pat.  “Oh, to <i>think</i> that it only belongs to the
Daisies till Midsummer Day, and that then, perhaps,
we’ll lose it!”  She gave a sigh and surveyed her
work from a distance.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll put you back before the sun takes the
glitter off you,” remarked Betty, as though addressing
one of the twins.  Then she broke off and rose
hastily to her feet as, from the house, sounding
musically peremptory, came the note of the dinner-gong.
Certainly the time was no longer her own.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Oh!</i>” cried Betty in dismay.  “Suppose I
lose the patrol a mark!”
</p>

<p>
It took her but a moment, however, to place back
the Cup through the open window on the little
ledge where its place was.  Another moment brought
her flying into the school door, and a third brought
her, panting and still wiping powder from her hands,
to join the end of the line of girls.  Only, however,
to be sent straight back by Stella&mdash;one of the
prefects&mdash;to finish her toilet below.
</p>

<p>
“Betty Carlyle, your skirt is covered with some
sort of powder.  Go back, please, and tidy
yourself before you go into the dining-room.”
</p>

<p>
It was a very flustered Betty who took her seat
five minutes later at the window table; and a quick
look of surprise from the head of her patrol as she
had passed the round table in the middle of the
room where the prefects sat seemed the last straw.
“And I was only trying&mdash;” thought Betty unhappily.
</p>

<p>
“You’ve lost us a mark; you’ve lost us a mark.
At least, if mascots count, you have,” remarked
Rene at her side.
</p>

<p>
Mona’s eyes from the other side of the table
seemed to emphasize the statement.
</p>

<p>
“If mascots counted!”  Betty’s cup felt as
full as it could hold.  She turned to Gerry.  But
even Gerry had lost her dimples.  “I say,” she said
in horror, “didn’t you hear first bell?  It’s
the very first dining-room mark in the patrol, you
know.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I almost hope that mascots <i>don’t</i> count!”
said Betty, almost in tears.
</p>

<p>
Mutton and potatoes tasted like nothing on
earth; so did the pudding.  And hasten slowly
time spent under the trees had lost all its charm
that afternoon.  Instead of sending her thoughts
inquiringly over the cottage in the wood, or remembering
the fairy piper, or working up stories to tell
to the twins next holiday, Betty felt hot at the back
of her eyes, and a regular lump of misery at the
back of her throat.  She had been too helter-skelter
again; and just when she’d been so keen to help.
She hadn’t “hastened slowly”; she had “snatched”
after helping, and so the helping hadn’t been worth
anything.  And to be the very first one to bring
a dining-room mark to the patrol!  What would
Sybil think of her?&mdash;the look in Sybil’s eyes had
shamed her badly enough.  And she was to have
brought the patrol luck!  And now&mdash;  Betty’s
thoughts raced miserably on through the whole
long hour.
</p>

<p>
It was at the end of the hour that the terrible
thing happened.  Unexpectedly.  To the surprise
of the juniors still resting under the shade of one
of the old trees, it was Sybil herself who left the
school doors and crossed the grass to summon them.
When she reached the place, although there had been
no hurry in her step, and although her tone as she
spoke was quiet and unflurried, there was an anxious
look in her blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Time,” she said slowly.  Then, standing still
on the grass facing the group under the trees, she
spoke again.  “I want to ask you all something,”
said Sybil, “before you get up.  Has any one of you
touched the Guide Cup?  It is missing from its
stand in the Oak Hall.”
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
WITH SYBIL, IN THE WOOD
</h3>

<p>
Betty had never spent such a day.  It had been
bad enough to have to blurt out before everybody
the fact that she herself must certainly have been
the last girl to have seen the Cup.  It was worse
to see the frank and absolute amazement in Sybil’s
face at her words.
</p>

<p>
“<i>You</i>&mdash;Betty?”
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;” began Betty nervously.  Her fingers
were flying by this time; she could hardly bring
out the words; and the sight of Sybil standing
quietly before her made her somehow feel all the
more what a harum-scarum helter-skelter she was.
</p>

<p>
“I only meant&mdash;I mean, I didn’t mean&mdash;” she
floundered.  Oh, if Sybil would only let her explain
the matter all by herself instead of standing, as
she was, in the midst of a group of junior Guides
all staring incredulously at her.
</p>

<p>
But the head of the Daisies did <i>not</i> make the
matter easier for her in that way.  Her eyes were
grave and quiet; but the blue of them looked
stern, Betty thought.  “Speak slowly; there is
no hurry.  Why did you touch the Cup at all
without leave?” said Sybil.
</p>

<p>
“It was to help.  I mean&mdash;I was cleaning it.
I took it out in the gardens.  I put it back.  I <i>know</i>
I did,” began Betty in a quivery voice.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, on account of the quiver, Dad
would have put his arm round her and called her
“Bet, pet,” and she would have felt better at once.
Sybil, who <i>could</i> be kind and sweet, as Betty knew,
did none of these things.
</p>

<p>
“You took the Guide Cup, then, from the shelf
without asking, Betty?  And cleaned it in the
garden without leave?  It did not occur to you,
then, that the Cup is the property of every one of
the Guides, and that we are the patrol responsible
for it this year.  As I am head of that patrol, you
should have asked <i>me</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“I just thought&mdash;”  Betty would have welcomed
a yawning cavern if it would only kindly have
opened its jaws to receive her.
</p>

<p>
But it did not.  She was left, for the first time
in her life, perhaps, to bear the brunt of her
helter-skelter ways as she stood for several moments
surrounded by the junior Guides of the company,
and with the full consciousness of Sybil’s cool,
quiet gaze fixed upon her while she waited
thoughtfully without speaking a word.
</p>

<p>
Then&mdash;“You took a very great responsibility
on yourself, Betty Carlyle, in doing what you did,”
said the head.  “I am afraid that indirectly your
action may be at the root of the loss of the Cup.”  She
spoke in tones as cold as the glance from her
blue eyes.  Then she turned and began to cross
the lawn again.
</p>

<p>
But even as she went she seemed to recollect
something, and for one instant turned again.  “All
of you juniors will go at once, please,” she said,
“and get ready for games.  As I have kept you
back for a moment it will be best, I think, for you
not to waste time now in talking while you change
your shoes, but to go straight to the field.  Gerry
and Betty, will you collect the rugs before you go?”
</p>

<p>
It was kind of Sybil.  Even at that moment,
even while Betty was in the direst disgrace that had
ever fallen upon her, the head girl had
realized&mdash;even while blaming the culprit&mdash;her state of
mind.  By this arrangement Betty gained a few
minutes’ breathing-space, with Gerry her friend at
her side, before joining the rest.  The Mascot bent
over her task with a crimson face.
</p>

<p>
<i>Would</i> Gerry say anything comforting?
</p>

<p>
But Gerry was apparently too much overwhelmed
to speak.  It was only when, carrying
the rugs between them, they had nearly reached
the house, that Betty summoned up courage to
gulp out an inquiry.
</p>

<p>
“Gerry,” she whispered in a panting voice, “I
didn’t mean anything.  I truly thought I was helping.”
</p>

<p>
Gerry said nothing.
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;Sybil doesn’t think I&mdash;<i>took</i> it, does she?”
said poor Betty.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Took</i> it!” almost shouted Gerry in an outraged
tone.  “<i>Took</i> it!  Do you mean to say that Sybil&mdash;or
any Guide&mdash;would think that of any other?
You may be only a mascot,” went on Gerry, “but
you’ve been at Benedick’s a month, and you ought
to know.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh.”  Betty was half-relieved but almost
half-frightened, too, by the vehemence of her friend’s
tone.  “Why&mdash;&mdash;?”
</p>

<p>
It was with Gerry’s next words that the full
force of the situation struck her.  “It’s not that
Sybil thinks that; she couldn’t.  We none of us
could.  And you couldn’t have done it; none of
us could.  But the Cup was taken by some one,
I suppose, who saw you with it.  A tramp, perhaps,
creeping in while we were at dinner.  And the
Cup is in the Daisies’ charge this year; and our
patrol is responsible for it.”
</p>

<p>
“But it will be found.  It couldn’t have gone
far.  I put it back quite carefully though I was
hurrying, so it couldn’t have slipped off the ledge,
or I would have thought it was just that.  Gerry,
you don’t mean that, if it isn’t found, the patrol
will lose <i>marks</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Marks!</i>” repeated Gerry almost scornfully.
“As though marks were everything!”  She
stopped.
</p>

<p>
The others were not so reticent.  On the arrival
of the two last-comers on the cricket field the
excited looks of the players were hard to bear.
When the game was over, too, and they all trooped
back through the grounds and on to the terrace for
tea, the same subject was on every lip.
</p>

<p>
“Is the Cup found?”
</p>

<p>
It was not, as Doron, prefect in charge of the meal,
told them all tersely.  She did not encourage
conversation in the matter, but it would have been
as easy for her to stem a mill-stream as to quench
the curiosity of the juniors.  Cowslips, Foxgloves,
Buttercups, Daisies&mdash;there was horror in every
eye.  Then it <i>was</i> gone.  It hadn’t just slipped
down or anything when Betty&mdash;Every one of
them stopped short at the utterance of her name.
Not one of them blamed her in words.  But there
was a look of horrified amazement in their eyes as
they gazed at her, which was worse, Betty felt, to
bear than anything at all.  A greater “worst”
came, however, when tea was over.
</p>

<p>
She was collecting her goods and chattels in a
corner of the study.  Her eyes were filled with
tears by this time, and she had found it difficult
for that reason to distinguish between the names
of the subjects written on the labels of her books.
She was still, perforce, then, gropingly trying to
mop her eyes when&mdash;the rest having found their
way preparation-roomwards&mdash;two prefects entered
the study for reasons of their own.
</p>

<p>
Doron and Sylvia talking together.
</p>

<p>
“I thought Sybil was taking on unnecessary
trouble for herself by adopting the child as mascot.”
</p>

<p>
It was Sylvia.
</p>

<p>
“Quixotic, I call it.  Especially when the Daisies
were so keen to hold the Cup for the second year,
and a newcomer might easily have pulled them
down.  Well, they’ve lost it now, I’m afraid; and
even though it will go to the Foxgloves instead,
yet Hilda was saying that it <i>is</i> hard on Sybil.”
</p>

<p>
“Lost the Cup; yes, in two senses.”  It was
Doron’s voice.  “I suppose you are right.  Miss
Carey could not overlook it, I should think.  She
would say, I expect, that even though the child
isn’t enrolled yet, Sybil should have had more
control over her.”
</p>

<p>
The said “child” suddenly appeared&mdash;choking,
speechless, rising from the lowest shelf but
attempting to face the two.  “I&mdash;” began Betty.
</p>

<p>
“Go and take your place in the preparation-room,”
said Sylvia in level tones.  “We did not
know you were there,” she added quietly, “or we
should not have said what we did in your hearing,
of course.  Still, you must know it some time.”
</p>

<p>
They had said she was to go to the preparation-room:
they expected her to obey, of course; but
Betty couldn’t.  Saddled even though she was
with books of every description, she took a flying
headlong race down the corridor and into the
cloakrooms behind.  Then she flung down her
impedimenta and hurried breathlessly miserable
into the garden.  She must get away; she must.
Up the green strip between the gardens into the
school wood behind she went, and flung herself
down under the trees.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-088"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-088.jpg" alt="And Sybil was seated beside her among the bracken.">
<br>
And Sybil was seated beside her among the bracken.
</p>

<p>
She had lost the Cup!  Even if it were found,
yet she had still lost it in another way to the Daisy
patrol!  The prefects had said so.  She, their
mascot, who had been taken on by Sybil in spite
of the fact that she might ruin their chances.  And
she had done this!  As she lay there face down in
the bracken and blue-bells, life seemed unhappier
than it had ever seemed before.  It was not until
she had sobbed till she was weary and weak that
she fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
It was from a medley of dreams that she was
roused.  She had been dreaming of the piper and
the cottage in the wood; and that the fairies were
guarding the Cup; and that the patrol had adopted
a fairy as a mascot instead of herself.  She gave
a little sob as she woke up, however, and as she did
so she heard a voice.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, poor little thing!” said the voice.  “Wake
up.”
</p>

<p>
It was Sybil’s voice, and Sybil was seated beside
her among the bracken.  It may have been the
first waking sight of her that had given the Mascot
the fairy dream, so she thought suddenly; because,
with a background of blue-bells and green trees,
Sybil, sitting there crowned with her halo of
corn-coloured hair, and with the old kind look in her
eyes again, might have been, to Betty’s eyes
anyhow, a most beautiful fairy princess.
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;” began Betty, sitting up and rubbing her
eyes; “I heard what they said; and it’s true.
And I&mdash;”  She began to cry again.
</p>

<p>
“I know what you heard,” said Sybil’s voice,
“for they told me.  They told me, too, that they
were sorry that you heard.  Well, in one way, Sylvia
is right; but in another way she was not.  Betty,
listen.  Even although, just because of your
helter-skelter ways, it seems that we may lose the Cup for
the patrol, yet I shall never be sorry we took you
as mascot.”  Sybil’s voice was quiet, and felt like
cool, refreshing springs to Betty’s thirsty heart.
</p>

<p>
“Why?” whispered Betty, turning tear-stained
eyes on the head girl.
</p>

<p>
“Just because you came to us to be trained
to be a true Guide; and if, in your learning, we
have to help you to buy your experience, we’ll
do it gladly, because we’re your fellow-Guides,”
said Sybil.  “You’ll learn more by this, I’m sure,
than in any other way.  Well, that will be knowledge
gained by all of us because you’re a part of
the patrol.  Betty, do you understand?”
</p>

<p>
Sybil bent down and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
And as Sybil kissed her, Betty knew one thing;
and that was that some day, even if it took a whole
lifetime of trying, she would hope to be like Sybil
herself, and to help other would-be Guides in just
the same way to try again.  She got up without
a word and smoothed back her hair.
</p>

<p>
“Go straight to the dormitory,” said Sybil in
a different tone.  “I guessed you might be here,
so I came to see.  It is nearly bedtime, and I will
ask Nurse if you may have something in bed instead
of supper.  Don’t fuss any more.”
</p>

<p>
Betty went.
</p>

<p>
She was in bed when the rest came up.  Perhaps
Sybil had spoken to them also; perhaps not;
Betty never knew.  But at any rate they began
to talk to each other, and did not trouble her to
join in.
</p>

<p>
“There’s one thing certain and sure,” said Mona,
“that there’ll be some reason now for that
tracking expedition next Saturday&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Betty fell asleep while the discussion was still
going on.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE TRACKING EXPEDITION
</h3>

<p>
A week had passed.  Saturday had come, and the
Cup was not yet found.
</p>

<p>
It had been, perhaps, the most sobering week
that Betty had ever spent in her life.  For, after
the meeting with Sybil in the school wood, she had
taken the head girl’s words to heart and had tried
to go about everyday things as quietly and evenly
as she could and in an everyday manner.  The
other juniors might look at her curiously now and
again as though wondering whether Betty had
forgotten.  But she had not.  At almost every moment
of the day she remembered that her helter-skelter
ways and lack of control had more than probably
been the cause of the loss of the Cup.  But she was
“trying not to fuss,” for she had learned a lesson
which she would never forget, and she had
formulated, too, in the wood the preceding evening, a
principle that she would never lose sight of through
all her schooldays to come.  She meant to work on
and on, “hastening slowly” until some day she
saw herself, like Sybil, helping some smaller Guide
than herself to higher courage and greater endeavour.
She would never forget Sybil’s words to her in the
wood: they went to hold a place&mdash;though the head
girl certainly did not guess it&mdash;among the “secret
beautiful things” in Betty’s heart which might
never be spoken about to any one at all.
</p>

<p>
Not that, after that evening, Betty had come
much into contact with the head girl.  She had
barely met Sybil again that week at all.  Only at
meal-times in the distance, and during the head
girl’s duty hours as prefect, did the two meet.
And to all outward appearances Betty’s life went
on just as before the loss of the Cup; for though
naturally its loss was the chief subject of every
conversation, nobody connected her name with the
loss, nor suggested by look or word that there might
be any such connection.  It was not until after
some days had passed that she herself dared to
broach the subject, which was always uppermost
in her mind, to Gerry, her friend.
</p>

<p>
“Gerry, do they think some one saw me cleaning
it, and then stole it?”
</p>

<p>
Gerry nodded.  “Well, it does seem like that.
All the girls have talked it over.  It couldn’t very
well have gone any other way.  Rene suggested a
jackdaw, but that’s silly, of course, for the Cup is
too heavy.  But it could easily have been lifted
down from the shelf by any one who climbed in
from the wood.  And if any one saw you sitting
there and cleaning it, and then saw you put it
back&mdash;”  Gerry stopped and looked awkward.
</p>

<p>
“But&mdash;” Betty spoke humbly&mdash;“but oh, I
know, of course, that I should have asked
permission, and that I didn’t.  But, Gerry, nobody
ever trespasses in the school wood.  What should
bring them there just that one day?  Nobody
would dare to because of Witch’s Wood being so
near.  So it does seem strange.”
</p>

<p>
“I know.”  Gerry nodded agreement.  “Miss
Carey told the police, though, and some of them
looked in the wood.  There were traces, I heard
Doron say, as though some one had been there.
‘Sign,’ you know.  And they think that a tramp
must have been resting there, and probably that
he was a stranger and didn’t know the silly stories
about Witch’s Wood.  It couldn’t possibly be a
villager, for none of them would dare to.”
</p>

<p>
“It does seem like that,” sighed Betty.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for it after that but just to
“keep on keeping on,” and to keep on hoping
against hope too, though the chances of the Cup’s
return seemed now very slight.  With the near
approach of Saturday, however, the spirits of the
dormitory juniors rose.
</p>

<p>
“It’s terribly appropriate just to be happening
to have a tracking expedition,” remarked Mona.
“Suppose&mdash;just suppose we found the Cup!”
</p>

<p>
“Hidden in a hole by a tramp, d’you mean?”
suggested Rene.
</p>

<p>
“Yes; or something like that.  Wouldn’t it be
simply glorious to bring the tramp to justice!  Just
like a book.  We might get a Guide medal from
headquarters, I should think.”
</p>

<p>
“You wouldn’t.  It sounds terribly un-Guidy to
say that it’s glorious to put tramps into prison,”
put in Gerry.  She turned to Betty for support.
</p>

<p>
“You mean friends of all the world?” said
Betty shyly.  “Yes, I think so too.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I must say!” Mona flared up at once.
“All I can tell you is, then&mdash;and Rene thinks the
same&mdash;that we two would do anything for the sake
of the patrol and for Sybil and everything.  We’d
do <i>anything</i> to get the Cup back.  And if Betty, of
all people&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“You know perfectly well that Betty’s as keen
to get it back as you are,” flared up Gerry in
return.
</p>

<p>
A grim silence fell on the cubicles.  Brushes
could be heard in vigorous use from the four corners
of the room.
</p>

<p>
Matters were still rather strained and the subject
was a chilly one between the couples next day.
Sybil, however, who with Eve&mdash;her second&mdash;and
Doris, Jean and Lilian, the older Guides of the
patrol, was to head the expedition, was certainly
in no mood to notice petty trifles such as Tenderfoot
feuds.  The patrol was marched out in business-like
fashion on to the moor, and the practice
began.
</p>

<p>
Vigorous, practical, and to the point, was the
scheme of the afternoon’s work.  The Tenderfoots
were taken in hand first by the captain herself, and
received a preliminary lesson in stalking and
sign-reading.
</p>

<p>
“Red Indians are wonders,” said Sybil; “there
are no tracking secrets hidden from them.  They
will lie in wait for hours; and the crumpling of
a leaf or the shade of difference in a sound means
everything to them sometimes.  Their food depends
on their scouting, you see, and their family’s food.
They learn ‘stalking’ because they would die if they
did not understand how to stalk.  In our country,
too, keepers and others look for ‘sign’ from morning
till night.  In the war, you’ll remember, scouting
played a tremendous part.”
</p>

<p>
“I say, Sybil, gipsies leave ‘sign’ behind,” put
in Mona, as they all squatted on the grass.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, they do.  <i>Patrin</i>, they call it.  And the
gipsies can follow each other just because of it.
It helps them more than we’d understand, I expect,
since they are roaming all the time.  I’ve seen
broom-making gipsies sitting on the backs of their
caravans and throwing down sometimes a bundle
of twigs, and marking their road along from one
town to another in that way.  A regular trail is
left behind; but only just plainly enough trailed,
of course, for a watchful person to see.”
</p>

<p>
“The ones that camp on the moor here make
baskets, you know,” put in Mona.
</p>

<p>
“Well, we are going to do something in the
<i>patrin</i> line this afternoon,” put in Sybil.  “It’s
much the same thing.  You must all learn by
following some definite clues, for we don’t want one
of you, even a mascot, to get lost in a wood again.
Eve and Lilian are going to lay down ‘sign,’ or
<i>patrin</i>, or whatever you like to call it, and you
four are to follow the scent.  They have started
already and are laying trail, and you must try to
follow on, after they have had a fair start, and track
them.  Try to track the way they went by noticing
any scraps of ‘sign’ they may leave; not only over
the next two ridges of the moor, but all the way,
try to keep exactly on their trail.  It is a very
simple test, and you may have an hour for it.  Then
come back here and bring reports.  Afterwards,
Eve will go over the ground with you and tell you
what you have missed and where you went wrong.
Remember to ‘hasten slowly’; you will miss a lot,
possibly, by hurrying.”
</p>

<p>
The four started off.
</p>

<p>
It was glorious.  The sun blazed down from overhead;
the grass was baking underfoot.  Betty’s eyes
were wide with eagerness as she and Gerry made their
way off together.  Eve was even now returning behind
the second ridge: and they were to bring back an
account of every bit of “sign” she had left <i>en route</i>.
The first “scent” was a footprint, imbedded
deeply, and evidently on purpose, in a piece of
upturned turf.  Gerry, Mona, and Rene discovered
it in chorus.
</p>

<p>
“Pointing east.  She’s gone that way.  Is it
Eve’s or Lilian’s?”
</p>

<p>
“Lilian is wearing tackets in her boots and
Eve isn’t, I noticed.  The footprint must be Eve’s.”
</p>

<p>
On they went.
</p>

<p>
There followed, with a yard or two between,
more and more traces of “sign”&mdash;a tiny bit of
paper crumpled up, which proved to be half of an
envelope addressed to Lilian; a tiny scrap of
patrol ribbon; more footprints; a lock of Eve’s
hair!
</p>

<p>
On and on went the practice.  Suddenly, just
as the top of the second ridge was reached, Mona,
who was a pace ahead, gave a little shout.
</p>

<p>
“Rene, I say.”
</p>

<p>
“What is it?” called Gerry.
</p>

<p>
But the others were whispering eagerly.  They
were bending down and didn’t answer.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a <i>patrin</i>.  It must be a real one.  A bundle
of sticks pointing this way,” said Mona at last.
“Rene says she is sure she saw more of it farther
back, but she thought it was some of Eve’s ‘sign.’  Well,
<i>this</i> can’t be, I’m certain.  It must be the
<i>patrin</i> of some gipsies on the moor.”
</p>

<p>
Gerry and Betty hung eagerly over the “sign.”
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt of it.  A little bundle of
rushes still fresh and green lay there.
</p>

<p>
“And close to the moor path,” shouted Mona.
“It was flung here from a passing caravan.  There
are marks of the wheels too, and the horse’s feet.”
</p>

<p>
“I say,” Gerry called after them, “you’re leaving
the ridge.”
</p>

<p>
But the excitement was by this time intense.
Mona and Rene were wild with eagerness.
</p>

<p>
“We’ll have to.  We’re going to follow.  Suppose
they’ve got the Cup!  Sybil said to come back in
an hour, and it’s not half an hour yet.  If you’ll
come along we can all go together, and be back
by the time the others do.  If we run back to ask
leave, she’ll probably not be there; and we shall
never catch up with the caravan.”
</p>

<p>
“But what are you going to do?  And why
should they have the Cup?” demanded Gerry.
“And besides, it’s a practice; and we’ve got Eve’s
‘sign’ to follow.”
</p>

<p>
“‘<i>Why?</i>’  It’s more than likely that they’ve got
it,” almost stamped Mona.  “And if you don’t
care about the Cup, Rene and I <i>do</i>!  I must say,
after last night, any one would think that you
two&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Mona was off.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not going,” said Gerry, sitting down on the
ridge.  “Betty, you’re not to either.  We might
go back to Sybil and ask; but she’s given us the
orders, and&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
The couples parted company.
</p>

<p>
But there was little enjoyment in searching after
“sign” when Mona and Rene had gone.  The
others heard several shouts of excitement as two
more bunches of the <i>patrin</i> were picked up; then
the adventurous pair disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
“I’m perfectly sure,” said Gerry, after almost
half an hour more had gone, as she and Betty were
just preparing to slip over the ridge, “that they
ought not to have gone.  But&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
They had been seated for a while on the topmost
ridge, counting up their “sign” discoveries in
preparation for their return.  It was just as they
had finished that they heard the sound of a step
behind them.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you’s the other two young ladies, is yer?”
said a voice.  Betty and Gerry turned.  “Well, an’
I’ll trouble you to come along.”
</p>

<p>
As they stared with amazement their gaze fell upon
a gipsy boy, who stood there, tall and handsome,
but with an insolent lowering look upon his face.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
LITTLE FRIEND OF ALL THE WORLD
</h3>

<p>
“But I don’t think we can!” said Gerry, staring.
“You see, we’re not allowed beyond this ridge.
We’re&mdash;tracking.”
</p>

<p>
“‘Tracking,’ is it!”  The lad’s face grew surlier.
“Well, an’ it’s you, then, sure enough, as is the
other young ladies, and my Dad arsks you to come
along.  If you’s tracking, you’s on the wrong scent,
he’d have you know.  An’ ’e’ll tell you so himself.
You can jest come along an’ hear what ’e’s got
to say if you’s them as tries to fix blame on folk
as lives honest.”
</p>

<p>
“But&mdash;” began Gerry again.
</p>

<p>
“Well, if you likes to say ’ere and now as you’s
not tracking, then it’s jest them two young ladies
up there as is in it,” remarked the boy, softening
a little at the amazed look on their faces.
</p>

<p>
“Gerry, he doesn’t understand,” began Betty.
“Perhaps&mdash;”  But Gerry broke in.
</p>

<p>
“We’re having a tracking practice.  Not tracking
people; at least, of course&mdash;” she broke off.
“The others are only practising too.”
</p>

<p>
“That they <i>isn’t</i>.”  The boy’s voice grew louder.
“Following travelling folkses; that’s what they’s
adoing, and picking up their travelling signs all
unpolite, and arsking them about who stole cups
and all!”  There was no mistaking the outraged
tone in the lad’s voice.
</p>

<p>
“Oh <i>dear</i>!” Gerry broke out in a distracted
voice.  She turned to Betty.  “We’ll have to go.
Perhaps we can explain.  They’ve got into dreadful
trouble evidently.  We <i>must</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“All right,” agreed Betty, feeling her knees
shaking under her.
</p>

<p>
But she felt that Gerry was right.  They
certainly must go, though the prospect was an
uninviting, not to say a terrifying, one.  The others
had plainly got into some trouble with the gipsies
of a caravan, that was certain, and they were
being detained.  Perhaps Gerry <i>would</i> be able to
explain if they went.  And anyway, they could
not leave Mona and Rene there alone.  She got
up as Gerry did, and followed her friend’s lead.
</p>

<p>
“It’s worse enough,” remarked the lad in a less
surly tone as they did so, “bein’ looked down by
the Romany folk what says they are the true folks
of the road, and calls us non-such and mumpers.
Mumpers belike we is, but we work fair an’ honest
fer a living, and the police passes us civil and knows
us for such.  An’ when two young ladies comes after
us callin’ and arsking ef we’s seen the silver cup
what’s advertised up in Woodhurst Police Station
as stolen&mdash;” he broke off in a mutter.
</p>

<p>
“Oh dear!” said Gerry again, but <i>sotto voce</i> this
time.  Here was indeed a pickle.
</p>

<p>
“‘You can jest step back and track <i>them</i> then,
Andy!’ so my Dad ses, ‘an’ we’ll show ’em whether
we’ve got stole cups on board.  The other young
ladies ses as there was two more of ’em a-tracking.
Well, bring ’em along,’ ses Dad.  ‘If so be as we’s
got to turn this here caravan back to the police
station we’ll do it, and face the young ladies, yes,
wiv the troof.  The police gives us a civil word
when they meets us, which is more than some
young ladies does!’”
</p>

<p>
“It’s perfectly dreadful,” remarked Gerry to
Betty.  “It’s quite plain what’s happened.
They’ve hailed the caravaners and offended them.
And&mdash;oh, why, here they all are!”
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-100"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-100.jpg" alt="The moor road where a caravan was standing.">
<br>
The moor road where a caravan was standing.
</p>

<p>
Just over the third ridge they came in sight of
the moor road again where a caravan was standing.
The horse between the shafts was munching
grass unconcernedly; but the driver&mdash;a grizzled,
middle-aged man&mdash;was standing in an aggressive
attitude still eyeing a pair of rather woebegone
maidens.
</p>

<p>
“I say, here you are!” began Mona indignantly,
as the others arrived.  “Has he brought you?  I
wish you would explain that&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“It’s explainings <i>I</i> wants,” burst out the owner
of the caravan angrily.  “Folks may be poor, but
they’s honest too; and they’s got their feelings.
And when two young ladies&mdash;” the plaint began
again.  “Mumpers we may be called by some, but
we earns a living fair and square and honest in
summer time by travelling.  An’ the police treats
us civil; and here we’s tracked down by young
ladies what calls us up fer stolen cups!”
</p>

<p>
“They didn’t mean&mdash;” began Gerry.
</p>

<p>
But Mona’s angry protestations, and Rene’s
tears, and Gerry’s beseechments were of little avail.
As for Betty, she stood by feeling even more useless
than the rest.
</p>

<p>
For it was evident that these were a party of
proud and respectable working-people who had been
wounded in their most vulnerable part by Mona’s
and Rene’s suspicious-sounding inquiries.  The
burden of the older man’s speech was the same as
that of his son’s.  If they were accused of stealing
silver cups by young ladies who had evidently
come out on purpose of tracking, well, they would
turn round and go straight back to the Woodhurst
Police Station, taking the young ladies in tow!
“To show as we’re fair and square and honest, and
that the police there knows us fine and treats us
civil,” repeated the man.  “Not to say that the
Weyhurst police knows us too, where we comes
from!”
</p>

<p>
“‘Weyhurst!’” repeated Betty in a surprised
squeak.
</p>

<p>
For Weyhurst was the town where she lived.
</p>

<p>
“‘Weyhurst!’ I ses and means,” said the older
man severely, evidently scenting further suspicions
in Betty’s surprised squeak.  “They knows me
fair and square there, from Weyhurst.  And if we’s
being tracked, I’ll show every one of you, down
Woodhurst here, w’ere we passed through this
morning, and was treated civil by the police,
whether Andrew Grimes&mdash;licensed travelling
broom-seller&mdash;ain’t respected by all atween Weyhurst
and Woodhurst, him an’ his wife Anna Grimes
too, wot is travelling in this here caravan at this
very minute.”
</p>

<p>
The said Anna Grimes put a tidy head through
the caravan door as though to prove the truth of
her husband’s remarks.  She was a decent middle-aged
woman, but her face was set in angry lines.
</p>

<p>
“An’ as I ses, to be sure,” she broke out, “we’s
enough trouble to make an honest living these
days without young ladies a-tracking us down, and
then going back, perhaps, an’ sending police after
us for cups.  As I ses&mdash;”  She broke off suddenly
with a cry of surprise.  “Dad, who’ve you got
<i>’ere</i>?” she called out in a different voice.
“Why&mdash;&mdash;!”
</p>

<p>
“Why&mdash;!” remarked Betty, too, at that instant.
</p>

<p>
For something in the look of Anna Grimes’s
face was familiar, though what the familiarity
consisted in she could not for a minute or two find
out.  The woman’s face was somehow connected
in her mind with home; and something unpleasant;
and&mdash;oh yes, with a <i>baby</i>!
</p>

<p>
It was at this instant that the woman, who had
disappeared inside the caravan for a moment after
uttering the exclamation, appeared in view again,
panting, and made her way down the steps carrying
a small child in her arms.
</p>

<p>
“Dad!  Well, I never, Dad!” she called excitedly,
addressing her surprised husband, but keeping her
eyes on the still more surprised Betty.  “Sure this
is the little young lady wot I’s always told you of
wot came running into doctor’s waiting-room and
kisses the baby.  Brought him luck, too, she did,
as I’ve always said; seeing as he got through the
fever so easy, and&mdash;”  The angry lines of her face
were all smoothed away.  She wore a comfortable
smile as she approached the girls.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-103"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-103.jpg" alt="Sure, this is the little young lady wot I’s always told you of.">
<br>
“Sure, this is the little young lady wot I’s always told you of.”
</p>

<p>
The “fever!”  At that word Betty
remembered everything.  The woman, Mrs. Grimes,
whose home her husband had said was at
Weyhurst, was the very woman who had brought the
screaming baby into Dad’s waiting-room, and to
whose aid she had hurried unasked in a fit of zeal,
only to earn for herself and the twins a legacy of
the said fever for which, as Dad had discovered,
the child had been sickening at the time.  The
action had seemed to be fraught with unmitigated
disaster at the time, but now&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
The whole caravan atmosphere had changed;
smiles took the place of frowns.  “It’s a mistake,
Dad, that’s what it is, Dad,” said the woman.
“You’ve been too ’asty-like.  Sure, the doctor’s
young lady wot kissed the baby she wouldn’t go
for to&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Then what for do the rest of ’em&mdash;?” began
Mr. Grimes, but in a very different tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
“Explain, Betty.  He’ll listen to you,” urged
Mona.
</p>

<p>
Thus adjured, the Mascot, feeling at the moment
how very little she really knew about Guiding, did
try to explain.  “Yes, I’m Betty Carlyle, and I
do remember the baby, and I’m very glad he got
well,” she said shyly; “and I wouldn’t, and not
one of us would, ever think you’d taken our Cup.
We’re Guides, and we’re friends of all the world,
you see&mdash;at least we’d like to be&mdash;and if we’ve done
anything un-Guidy, we’re very sorry,” she finished
up.
</p>

<p>
“It was us that did; not you and Gerry.  And
we are awfully sorry,” put in Mona, addressing
Mr. Grimes.
</p>

<p>
“Well, you can’t say no more than that same.
And it’s only fair and square to take your word,”
remarked the caravan owner, extending a horny
fist.
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes the entire party were the best
of friends.  Apologies had been exchanged between
Mona and Rene and the Grimes family; kisses had
been exchanged between the Guides and the baby.
(“There’s not a mite of risk, little Miss Carlyle,
dear, not this time anyways; an’ you can tell the
doctor, your Dada, with our duty, as how you met
us an’ the baby was doing fine; fer a true friend
he’s been!”)  The caravan started again upon its
way, while the Guides, still waving in response to
salutations with a whip, turned their course towards
the arranged meeting-place with the head girl.
</p>

<p>
“I say, we’ve got to tell Sybil,” remarked Mona.
“And we’ll deserve anything for letting down the
Guides.”  They marched gravely along four abreast
without saying a word for a while.
</p>

<p>
It was Rene who suddenly, as they reached the
last ridge, voiced the thoughts of herself and Mona.
“I say, it was wonderful about you and the baby,”
she remarked, turning to Betty.  “If it hadn’t
been that you’d been so friend-to-all-the-worldy,
you know&mdash;and even before you’d ever heard of
Guides, too!&mdash;we might have had a much worse
time!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” agreed Mona.
</p>

<p>
Betty said nothing, but her heart gave a jump of
joy.
</p>

<p>
“She’s proved that she’s a real true Mascot
anyway, hasn’t she?” remarked Gerry loyally.
</p>

<p>
“Rather,” agreed the others.
</p>

<p>
Betty’s heart suddenly felt lighter than it had
felt for days.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE PIONEER PICNIC
</h3>

<p>
The days had gone by since the tracking expedition;
but nothing had been heard of the Cup.  The junior
Daisies had walked warily, however, since then&mdash;the
unfortunate result of their excessive zeal having
been a lesson to each one of the four girls concerned.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps to Mona and Rene particularly, however;
for, until that afternoon, they had been rather
inclined to look down a pair of superior noses at the
Mascot whose unthinking ways had more than
probably brought about the loss of the Cup.  Now
they themselves had brought trouble by their
own lack of thought; trouble, too, out of which
the Mascot had, by a kind of miracle, delivered
them.  Sybil, when the account of the afternoon’s
adventures was duly rendered to her, spared no
sympathy at all for the delinquents concerned.
</p>

<p>
“You went after the caravan and asked&mdash;”  Her
voice sounded incredulously cold.  “You <i>dared</i> to?”
</p>

<p>
“Not if they’d stolen it, Sybil.  Honest Injun,
we didn’t ask them that.  They just took it that
way!”
</p>

<p>
“And wouldn’t you have ‘taken it that way’ if
you had been in their place?  It comes to exactly
the same thing.  I don’t wonder that their pride
was hurt.  Have you no imagination at all?  Miss
Carey must know what you have told me, of course.
It’s just unthinkable that Guides should have done
it&mdash;even Tenderfoots.  Yes, as you say, Betty has
proved herself a mascot this afternoon.  It was very
strange, in one way, that she should have happened
to know them; but it’s not strange in another.
She might have known them, and yet&mdash;”  Sybil
stopped.  “Do you see what I mean?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“You mean that it wasn’t because they’d seen
her before, but because she’d been so Guidy to
the baby that made them feel friendly,” put in
Gerry.
</p>

<p>
“That’s exactly it, Gerry.  Betty was ‘Guidy,’
as you called it, then&mdash;even before she knew us,
or joined the Daisies.  It’s nice to think that her
enrolment as a real Tenderfoot will not be long in
coming now.”
</p>

<p>
Sybil gave Betty a very kind smile, for she knew,
as did all Betty’s other acquaintances, that the
Mascot was straining every nerve and working with
all her heart and soul towards the moment of her
investiture, which had been arranged for on the next
Midsummer Day.  That Midsummer Day was also
Cup Day, Betty knew as well as the rest.
Midsummer Day was coming very close now, too, and
it seemed likely that there could be no tangible
trophy at hand when the award took place.  The
Daisies had all faced the fact that they must be
passed over as “best patrol” in favour of the
Foxgloves, who ranked next in order of merit; that
next year the Foxglove patrol must take first
place in Hall under the little empty ebony stand
seemed only just and fair.  But they were working
extra hard, every one of them; and if Mona and
Rene had forgotten once to “hasten slowly” during
their experience on the moor, that very experience
had served as a lesson in the Guide law which
neither of them would forget.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile work went on in classrooms and
on the playing-fields, in the Guide-rooms and in
the gardens, and Midsummer drew nearer every
day.
</p>

<p>
Midsummer weather, too, prevailed, hot and
glorious.  “Fine weather for the huts,” was the
universal morning greeting of certain senior Guides.
For one of the interests of the summer term at
St. Benedick’s was the yearly erection of huts in the
clearing in the wood by any of the older Guides
who had obtained permission to work for their
Pioneer badges.
</p>

<p>
“The clearing’s kept specially for it,” as Gerry
told Betty.  “None of us go there.  It takes them
weeks and weeks to build them; for they don’t
hurry through them, but just work at them when
they’re free.  Sybil got her Pioneer badge last
year; but Eve of the Daisies, and Jean, who’s
second in the Foxgloves, and Louise, who’s a
Buttercup, are all working for their Pioneers this year.
And when the huts are ready there’ll be a
‘hut-warming.’”
</p>

<p>
“A hut-warming?” repeated Betty.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, and it’s to be the Saturday before
Midsummer Day.  That’s decided,” Gerry informed
her.  “They’re making a camp kitchen, too, and
on the night after the ‘warming’ the Pioneers
are to be allowed to camp there.  Miss Drury’s
camping with them.  It will be tremendous fun
for them, I should think; they’re to cook their
own supper and breakfast next day, and act just
like Robinson Crusoes.  I’m simply longing to be
far enough on to work up for my Pioneer badge!”
</p>

<p>
Betty certainly agreed that it sounded one of
the “most thrilly” of the badges, and looked
forward with as much zest as the rest for the Pioneer
entertainment.
</p>

<p>
“If the weather&mdash;!” was the remark on everybody’s
lips during the week preceding the great
day.
</p>

<p>
But there was no “if” about the weather at
all when Saturday eventually arrived.  The
Pioneer hut-makers had spent an energetic week.  They
had taken advice from Miss Drury and from older
girls who had pioneered before them; their camp
kitchen’s possibilities had been secretly and privately
tested; their huts had received all finishing touches
in good time.  “The ‘hut-warming’ only lasts
for two hours&mdash;from four to six,” as Gerry told
Betty; “but it’s tremendous fun.  They do
everything, you see&mdash;baking the cakes and all.  It
generally takes the whole two hours, though, just
to eat the meal because it’s all such fun!  And
then&mdash;well, we don’t stay very long because they’ve
got to arrange their night camp, and, of course,
they’re not awfully experienced in the ways of
things.”
</p>

<p>
The “Pioneers,” however, proved particularly
brainy ones that year.  They advanced to meet
their guests, each from her wigwam door, dressed
in Red Indian garments of their own fashioning
and design, and proceeded to provide a feast as
pioneery as it was peculiar.  Instead of tea the
guests were served with a beverage which the hosts
had prepared from nettles, and pronounced “absolutely
non-poisonous and much more pioneery.”  Wild
strawberries and raspberries in limited quantities
figured on the menu, but the pièce de résistance
of the feast was the quantity of damper-cakes
and bannocks cooked over the embers of the fire.
They might be slightly doughy in their interiors
and might cause the interior organs of the guests
to feel slightly doleful afterwards, but “it was
worth it,” as Gerry declared to Betty on their way
back, when the “hut-warming” was over and the
Guides were left to themselves for the night.
</p>

<p>
“Rather,” agreed Betty, but in a very abstracted
tone.
</p>

<p>
“What’s wrong?  Did you eat too many of
them?” inquired Gerry sympathetically.  “I
thought you suddenly seemed rather&mdash;well, glum!”
</p>

<p>
But Betty’s “glumness” was not the result of
damper-cakes, as she proceeded to explain, though
the explanation was not apparently easy to make.
“I say, Gerry,” she burst out suddenly.  “Look!”  From
her pocket she produced a coloured object
of a ribbony texture.  “It was in a bush,” blurted
out Betty.  “Close to the Witch’s Wood fence,
you know, where we were all sitting at tea.  And I
suddenly saw it, and pulled it out.”
</p>

<p>
“Why,” said Gerry, staring, “one of the Daisies
must have lost it.  It’s a bit of our patrol ribbon.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what I thought,” burst in Betty; “but
only just at first.  Look here, Gerry; listen.  It
may be that; but then it mayn’t.  You see, it
couldn’t have been lost to-day, because it’s been
wet with rain and all tousled, and looks as though
it had been there for weeks.  And the Guides
wouldn’t push ribbon into a bush, and&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” inquired Gerry, staring.  “But even
if not, I don’t see&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“It’s tied in a bow, you see,” went on Betty;
“and&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” inquired Gerry, staring still.
</p>

<p>
“And oh, Gerry, don’t you see?  Why, our
patrol ribbon was tied on to the Cup!  In a bow,
too; for I untied it and tied it up again that
morning when I cleaned it.  And it seems to
me&mdash;”  Betty stopped.
</p>

<p>
“Betty!”  Gerry was staring now in good
earnest.  “You don’t think that the Cup’s hidden
somewhere in the school wood, do you?  Why,
the Guides have searched, you know.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know <i>what</i> to think,” said Betty, looking
more miserable than ever.  “The fact is, Gerry,
I’m beginning to wonder if I’ve done something
else silly and helter-skelter without meaning to.
An idea has just come to me.  I’ve never told
any one at all about it, but now&mdash;”  She stared
from the ribbon to Gerry as though wondering
what to say next, or whether to leave something
still unsaid.
</p>

<p>
“Whatever do you mean?” asked her friend.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
BETTY SHARES THE SECRET
</h3>

<p>
“And the queer thing was, that we all of us saw
it!  Even Miss Drury!”  Eve was speaking to
a circle of interested listeners on the evening after
the night camp in the wood.
</p>

<p>
“Weren’t you nervous?” inquired some one.
</p>

<p>
“Nervous&mdash;pooh!  Of the witch, you mean?
That silly story!  Why, it wasn’t till this morning
that a single one of us even remembered it!”
</p>

<p>
“Did the light come from the haunted cottage,
do you think?” put in some one.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know anything except that there
certainly <i>did</i> seem to be a moving light.  I don’t
even know, for one thing, in what part of the wood
the cottage is supposed to be!  I only know that
I don’t believe in ‘haunts’ of any kind,” continued
the narrator briskly.  “I daresay it was a glow-worm
of monstrous size, or a keeper, perhaps, on
the prowl.  Whatever it was, we saw no more of it!”
</p>

<p>
“You forget the music!” put in one of the other
Pioneers.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-113"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-113.jpg" alt="&quot;There certainly <i>did</i> seem to be a moving light.&quot;">
<br>
“There certainly <i>did</i> seem to be a moving light.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh yes, we heard that too!  We all sat up on
our elbows and listened to it.  Like a flute playing.
It probably came from the road, though it sounded,
certainly, as though it issued from Witch’s Wood!”  Eve
laughed.  “Miss Drury said that if last night
instead of to-night had been Midsummer Eve we
might have been in the thick of a fairy revel!
But it didn’t keep us awake; we all floated off
into deep slumber.  Perhaps it may have been a
magic lullaby, for not one of us stirred until Miss
Drury fairly commanded us to wake this morning!”  Eve
moved off.  “Well, the Pioneering’s over,”
remarked she; “and Midsummer Day’s to-morrow
with&mdash;whatever it brings.  I only wish it could
bring the Cup!”
</p>

<p>
There was no need for words; every one else
was wishing the same wish too.  Everybody,
strange to say, at that moment except Betty!
</p>

<p>
For the last scrap of Eve’s sentence had not
even been heard by her.  She was remembering
with all her might and main the words that had
gone before.  She stood speechless with surprise,
still wondering, for several moments after Eve
had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
<i>What</i> had Eve said?  Had she <i>really</i> said it?
Could Betty’s ears by any chance have misled
her? she asked herself.  That the pioneering Guides
from their night camp had seen a light from Witch’s
Wood!  Also that they had heard the sound of
flute-playing!  Like a fairy revel; like a magic
lullaby, Eve had said.  She had been only laughing,
of course; but could it be&mdash;oh, could it possibly
be that the magic was true?
</p>

<p>
For a certain suspicion had been dawning in
Betty’s imaginative mind ever since yesterday.
It had seemed too unlikely an idea, so she had
told herself at first, to be true, and she had decided
not to take any one into her confidence, not even
Gerry, in case her ideas should be laughed at as
absurd.  But now&mdash;well, she could not keep the
idea to herself any more.  After supper on Sunday
evenings the girls were always free to walk about
the grounds in couples until bedtime.  To-night
Gerry was to be Betty’s partner.  After hearing
what Eve had just said, the Mascot could hardly
wait until the after-supper-time came.
</p>

<p>
“Gerry&mdash;&mdash;!”
</p>

<p>
“Whatever is it?” inquired Gerry solicitously.
That Betty’s state of mind was one of extreme
anxiety about something or other had been evident
all through supper-time.  She had eaten nothing
and had narrowly escaped an early dismissal to
bed on account of her lack of appetite.  “Though
perhaps the hour outside will do you as much good
as an extra hour in bed in this hot weather,” as
Nurse had conceded at last.  “No doubt you’re
excited about your investiture to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Is</i> it the investiture?” inquired Gerry now.
</p>

<p>
“It is, and it isn’t.  At least it isn’t that really,
except in so far as that everything’s so
tremendously connected.”  Betty gave a sigh.  “Gerry,
I’ve something to tell you.  I almost told you when
you asked me last night; only I couldn’t.  I was
afraid you might&mdash;well&mdash;that you might laugh at
me, you know.  And that would ‘take the bloom
off’ so, like Sybil said.”  Betty stopped.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know one bit what you mean; but
I shan’t laugh,” said Gerry quickly.
</p>

<p>
For even if Betty’s story were to be a queer one,
yet it couldn’t be exactly a laughable one, Gerry
was sure from the look in her friend’s eyes.  She
listened without a word until the telling was
through.
</p>

<p>
But by the time the story was done Gerry’s
expression of face had changed from one of
amazement to one of extreme incredulity.  At its last
word she stood still and said nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t believe it?” burst out Betty.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t see how I could.  Betty, how could
<i>any</i> one?  It seems so impossible.”  Gerry’s eyes
were thoughtful.  “Just because you found that
bit of patrol ribbon in the hedge which might
possibly have come off the Cup!”
</p>

<p>
“It did.  It did.  I recognized the bow,” put in
Betty.
</p>

<p>
“Well, even if it did, it needn’t mean that the
witch had taken the Cup!  Particularly when,
after all, there isn’t one&mdash;a witch, I mean!  How
<i>could</i> there be?  Guides don’t believe in such
things!”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t say exactly a witch!” put in Betty
vehemently.  “I said the magic that was there
might have had something to do with the losing
of the Cup!  You never saw the cottage, and I
<i>did</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“I know,” agreed Gerry.  “And I must say I
can’t think why you didn’t mention it before, if
you thought&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t think; and I mean, I was trying to
‘keep the bloom on’; because it all seemed so
strange and lovely for magic to be keeping the
cottage so sweet and flowery.  And I thought
‘I shan’t tell any one’; and then the idea came
to me afterwards that perhaps I oughtn’t to have
stepped inside, and that the magic had punished
me for trespassing by taking away the Cup, you
see,” finished up Betty lamely.  “Oh, I know it
sounds silly!  I told you you would want to laugh.
And it <i>has</i> ‘taken the bloom off’ to tell it,” said
Betty, almost in tears.  “But when the Pioneers
did see a light in the wood, and <i>did</i> hear the fairy
piper, why, I thought I ought&mdash;for the sake of
every one&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not laughing,” said Gerry; and she certainly
wasn’t.  She was staring straight at Betty
as though she could make neither head nor tail
of her story.  “As to going into Witch’s Wood,
though, to-night, and looking in the cottage to see
whether the Cup’s there, you simply <i>can’t</i> do that!
And you would never get leave to do it, I’m sure,
if you asked.  Truly, I do think it’s all rather&mdash;well,
far-fetched,” she finished up, wrinkling her
brows.
</p>

<p>
“Oh dear,” Betty sighed.  But in the light of
her friend’s common-sensible remarks she was
beginning to think how helter-skelter again her
imaginings must have been.  After all, perhaps
it was just a coincidence that the Pioneers had
heard music in the night.  The sounds might have
come from the far road, as some one had suggested,
and the light might have issued from a hundred
other more likely sources than that of a magic
lamp!  Gerry was probably right; but Betty sighed.
</p>

<p>
“If only&mdash;” said she.  “I somehow don’t feel
as though it could be right for me to wear my
Tenderfoot’s badge until the Cup is found!”
</p>

<p>
She went upstairs soberly enough, and got into
bed that night without a word.  To-morrow was
Midsummer Day, and the Cup was lost; to-morrow
she was to be admitted into the Daisy patrol.
But&mdash;  There was a very great deal of twisting and turning
before Betty fell asleep that night.
</p>

<p>
She woke early, too, on the next morning.
Half-past six o’clock was sounding from the village
church tower as she opened her eyes and became
conscious of the scents and sounds and sights of
the early Midsummer morning.  To-day was the
day of the investiture, but the Cup was still lost!
To-day she was to be enrolled as one of the Daisies;
but owing to her own carelessness the Cup which
her patrol had held in trust for a year was lost
not only to them but to the entire company of
Guides.  Betty was blinking back tears, hidden as
she was in the fastness of her own cubicle, while
the rest of the dormitory still slumbered round her,
when she suddenly remembered Sybil’s words of
the wood, “Don’t <i>fuss</i> about it!”
</p>

<p>
Betty <i>wouldn’t</i> fuss, she told herself.  She pulled
herself together, though, with a considerable effort.
To lie in bed without worrying was too difficult;
she got up very quickly and began to dress.
</p>

<p>
It was quite usual at St. Benedick’s for any Guide
who woke early to appear in the gardens before
breakfast-time.  Betty had often risen early before,
but never so early as on this particular day.  “Eve
said the sweet peas had got blown about and the
stakes needed looking at,” she reminded herself.
“Well, that will be something that I can do! There
may be other girls in the gardens too!”
</p>

<p>
There were not, however.  As it happened,
Betty found herself working alone; and for a while
she gardened on busily and happily enough while
the school still slept.
</p>

<p>
It was just as she was standing back and surveying
her work with her face turned from the fence
which divided the gardens from the school wood
that she suddenly heard a voice.  The sound of her
own name, too, called in no uncertain tones from
the bushes of the wood.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
EVERYTHING COMES RIGHT!
</h3>

<p>
Betty was gone!  Her clothes were gone, too;
and the occupants of the dormitory had taken it
for granted on waking that the energetic Mascot
had risen early as on previous occasions for extra
gardening practice.  It was only when, on the
sounding of the breakfast-gong, there appeared no
sight of Betty in her usual seat that surprised
comments ran down the garden table.
</p>

<p>
“Another <i>mark</i>!  You don’t mean&mdash;&mdash;!”
</p>

<p>
“Where is Betty Carlyle?” inquired the prefect
in charge.  “Do any of you juniors know?”
</p>

<p>
Not one of them knew, however.  A universal
shaking of heads prevailed.
</p>

<p>
“Go out into the gardens, Gerry,” commanded
Miss Drury from the wallflower table; “she must
be there.”
</p>

<p>
But Betty was not there, though the presence of
certain gardening tools proclaimed the fact that
the Mascot must certainly have spent some time
in working close to the sweet-pea hedge.
</p>

<p>
“Miss Drury, her gardening scissors are there.
Some raffia, too.  Just lying about!”  Gerry’s
eyes were wide.
</p>

<p>
“Go back to your seat, Gerry, and finish your
breakfast.  One of the prefects will go and look
for her.”  Miss Drury’s tones were as
common-sensible as ever.
</p>

<p>
But little breakfast was possible for Gerry.  She
was beginning to grapple with an idea.  Where
was Betty?  Already all the window-table girls
were beginning to whisper, and the whispers were
spreading round the room.  Doron, the prefect
who had been sent out to continue the search, had
returned too, and Miss Drury herself had left the
room after requesting Sybil to take her place at
the head of the wallflower table.
</p>

<p>
“Please say grace when every one has finished,
Sybil, and dismiss the girls to the grounds as usual.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, Miss Drury.”
</p>

<p>
Their tones were level and quiet.  Sybil’s tones
in pronouncing grace and in uttering the usual
commands were level and quiet too.  But it was
quite certain that “something” had happened.
Gerry, feeling strangely desolate without Betty’s
presence, made her way into the grounds alone.
</p>

<p>
Where was Betty?  Was her disappearance in
any way connected with the queer story which
she had told Gerry last night?  Could it be
that&mdash;  Her thoughts were broken into by fragments of
conversation overheard from the lips of passing couples.
</p>

<p>
“On the day of her investiture, too!”
</p>

<p>
“She looked awfully bothered yesterday evening.
And did not say one word while she was
undressing&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Do you think it’s anything about the Cup?”
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, in the midst of the chattering, came
the summons from the bell.  Lines were made, as
usual, without more speaking; in single file the
girls made their way into the Hall&mdash;all but one;
the Mascot’s place was empty, and Gerry felt Miss
Carey’s glance rest for a moment longer upon the
vacant space as her eye travelled down the Hall.
</p>

<p>
But prayers were said, the roll was called;
then, before the order came to leave the room, the
headmistress stood up and looked down steadily
at the lines before her.
</p>

<p>
“It appears that Betty Carlyle is missing.  Will
any girl who can give any reason&mdash;possible or
probable: any reason at <i>all</i>!&mdash;for her absence,
stand out from the lines while the rest file out.”
</p>

<p>
Gerry, three minutes afterwards, found herself
standing alone in the big Oak Room while the
headmistress descended from the little platform
and came to her side.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Geraldine?”
</p>

<p>
“Miss Carey, I think&mdash;I’m almost sure, that
Betty has gone to Witch’s Wood!”
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
“But&mdash;!” said Betty.
</p>

<p>
“He’s ill, poor lad, and askin’ for you.  Won’t
lay quiet.  My man fetched doctor to un last
night, and he told us&mdash;doctor did&mdash;to give un
anything wot he fancied, ’im bein’ in such a bad way.
So I come along ’cos I knew you’d come, little
Miss Carlyle&mdash;you with the soft heart as kissed
the baby.  And sure, too, it’s the Cup he’s talkin’
about, end on.  An’ it bein’ Midsummer Day&mdash;”  The
speaker stopped for breath and mopped a
heated brow.
</p>

<p>
“But who <i>is</i> ‘he’?” inquired Betty, staring.
</p>

<p>
She had got used to the first surprise&mdash;that of
suddenly seeing behind her in the school wood the
figure of Anna Grimes of the caravan, dishevelled
and dusty, certainly, but with the delight of
recognition in her eyes.  How she had got there Betty
hadn’t had time to consider as yet, owing to the
torrent of talk which flowed from her visitor’s lips.
</p>

<p>
“I come meself, little Miss Carlyle; me man was
against it.  But the poor lad being in such a bad
way, I couldn’t cross him, being soft-hearted myself.
Comed up to our van, he did, early yesterday
morning, arsking for water.  Fell asleep while he
were drinking of it, he did, poor natural, and I
threw a coat over him and let him lay there.  Well,
as my man says, the beasts and the poor naturals
is sort of specials, in a manner of speaking, if you
takes my meaning, and we munna go agin them.
So, w’en ’e wakes up all shivery and ’ot at noon,
an’ arsks whether it be Midsummer yet, and if so
why he be so cold, and whether t’ Cup be safe, and
all about the sweet young lady wot was afraid to
lose it&mdash;well, at first we thinks of ’im as
light-’eaded.”  Mrs. Grimes stopped for breath.
</p>

<p>
“Talking about that there Cup ’e were, though,”
she went on; “and so we listens.  ‘Miss Betty’s
’er nyme,’ says ’e, quite sensible, too.  ‘I’se ’eard
the other young ladies call ’er,’ says ’e.  ‘My young
lydy she is,’ ses ’e again, ‘wot patched up my
cheek.  An’ I guv her my word,’ he goes on, ‘to
do summut for ’er in return.  Aye, an’ I done it,’
ses he.  All sensible so far, as my Andrew says;
but then the poor natural starts a-crying out with
pains in his boneses, and arsking if it be Midsummer
Day yet, ’cos ’e’s got to guv the young lydy the
Cup wot ’e’s kep’ safe for ’er till then.  ’E ’eard ’er
say over the garding wall as she was afraid she’d
lose it, ses ’e.  Well, an’ ’e got worser at night;
and my man goes to fetch doctor.  An’ doctor comes
and ses ’tis rheumatiz fever caught with laying out
o’ nights&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t understand one word, I don’t think,”
broke in Betty, almost trembling.  “At least I
believe I’m beginning to.  Only&mdash;”  She gave a
hurried look around.
</p>

<p>
“An’ no need for you to, Miss Carlyle, dear.
You just come along o’ me.  Doctor says ’twill
worsen him to keep calling, and it’s calling out fer
you that he’s after.  Wants to give her the Cup,
so ’e says&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“But how?  And I ought to ask leave&mdash;&mdash;!”
</p>

<p>
“Sure, ’tis the doctor’s leave as you’s got.  There’s
no time to lose, Miss Carlyle, dear.  An’ you can
come along this way.  ’Tis the way found by
himself, poor natural; but he described of it to me
proper clever.  ‘You goes along,’ ses ’e, ‘to that
there medder bordering the road.  An’ close by
there,’ ses ’e, ‘you’ll see a wide ditch-like way, with
nettles growing thick so as no one notices.  Dry it
be in summer, and deep it be; and you goes along
careful; and there be room to walk nigh upstanding
all way through medder till you comes to the
wood what belongs to St. Benedick’s school and sees
the flowers.  Aye, they’re grand to watch, a-laying
secret in the ditch,’ ses he, ‘but the young ladies
is grander; but go careful there fer fear they sees
you, and crouch and crawl.’  Well, I promises
him to take that there way, it being a full mile
quicker an’ nearer.  So, see here, Miss, step along
now; for you’re safe with me, as you knows, and
the lad’s right-down bad wi’ calling for you.”
</p>

<p>
Hardly knowing what she did, Betty followed
Anna Grimes’s lead.  Parting the great tangled
mass of grasses and bracken at the side of the wood,
the woman displayed the opening of a wide disused
ditch.  She crouched down and started off, while
Betty followed on behind.
</p>

<p>
Here was a thrilly adventure, indeed, if she had
had time to think of the journey in that light as
she followed her guide.  But Betty’s mind was
working too rapidly as she made two and two into
a sensible four, while thinking out the information
scraps which Mrs. Grimes had given her.
</p>

<p>
For “he” must be the poor boy of the
adventure on that day when she had clambered out of
Witch’s Wood and taken his part against the
village urchins who had been ill-treating him.  But
what could he know of the lost Cup?  “Well”&mdash;a
light seemed to be gradually dawning over things
as she thought&mdash;“he knew this queer way along
from the meadow; and so he’s known the way
into our school wood.  And he’s been there&mdash;Mrs. Grimes
says so; and he’s watched me gardening.
And he heard me say, on that morning when I was
talking to Gerry (and I <i>did</i> say it, for I remember),
that I would rather anything happened than that
we should lose the Cup.  I said, too (I <i>did</i> say it,
or else Gerry did), that we wanted to keep it on
Midsummer Day.  Oh, what comes next?  I suppose
he mixed it up in his poor head and didn’t
understand,” said Betty to herself in a motherly
way, just as her thoughts were switched off the
matter for a moment by the sound of Anna Grimes’s
voice just ahead.
</p>

<p>
“We’s out of the ditch-like way now, Miss, and
here’s the medder.  You can stand up now and
stretch yerself proper before we goes on.  ’Twill
on’y be a little ways on now.  The van’s down the
moor a bit, nearer than we was last time you sees us.
Out of the winds&mdash;”  The queer pilgrimage continued.
</p>

<p>
It was more than a relief from the strangeness
of things when, as the caravan came at last in sight,
another vehicle appeared beside it&mdash;nothing less
ordinary and everyday-looking than the doctor’s
car&mdash;and the school doctor, Rene’s father, came
himself to meet them.
</p>

<p>
“Tch, tch.  What’s this now, Mrs. Grimes?
Your husband said you’d gone for the young lady,
but I could hardly credit it.  Well, I was just off
to the school myself, it happens.  Now, my dear&mdash;Betty
Carlyle, isn’t it? you see, I’ve heard all
about you from Rene, and I know the story of
the Cup, and I’ve heard the end of the tale as told
by these good folk here&mdash;step straight into my
car while I speak to Mrs. Grimes for a minute.
And then I’ll take you straight back to St. Benedick’s.
This is no place for you, although the good
woman no doubt thought she was obeying orders.
It appears”&mdash;Dr. Fergus turned as he spoke&mdash;“that
we’ve got your Cup back safely, or, at least,
shall have it very shortly, thanks to poor Paul.”  His
tone changed, and he broke off into a long list
of directions as he addressed the van-woman;
while Betty, with her heart beating wildly with
excitement, possessed her soul in patience until
he should be free to appear.
</p>

<p>
It was almost half an hour later, while driving
her back to the school, that Dr. Fergus explained
further.  “In Witch’s Wood; the poor lad’s
hidden it there&mdash;in the cottage.  It seems that
he found out the fact (which no one else among
the village people appears to have found out, by
the way) that there aren’t such things as ghosts!
And he’s evidently adopted the so-called ‘haunted
cottage’ there, and has used it as a kind of refuge.
He’s got a bad granny, poor boy, who doesn’t do
her best by him, and he’s taken to camping there.
Plays his pipe, too, there; he’s a bit of a musician,
poor lad, as these naturals often are.  Spoke
of the fairies&mdash;well, poor lad, poor lad, he’s got
paid out with a bad attack of rheumatic fever
for any trespassing he’s done.  Oh yes, the Cup’s
there, evidently as safe as can be, in the little house.
He says he was guarding it for you, Miss Betty;
and for you, by the way, he seems to have a genuine
devotion.  He told me that you wanted it kept
safe till Midsummer Day!”
</p>

<p>
Betty felt a lump in her throat.  “He&mdash;he’s
muddled up what I said!  But I <i>did</i> say it,” she
whispered; “and it’s kind of him to want to help.
I did very little for him, you know.  Only&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Eh?  Well, I daresay you’ll be able to do a
bit more in the future, then.  I understand that
all you Guides are out to help others in need of
help, and here’s a genuine case.  He’ll be ill for
some time, but we’ll get him moved to the infirmary,
and he’ll be proud of a little notice, I’m sure.  See&mdash;”
the doctor suddenly slowed down&mdash;“here’s my
idea, Miss Betty,” said he.  “It happens that
we’re on the border of Witch’s Wood now, and
I’ve the right to go in, I believe.  Suppose we leave
the car in charge of the reputed witch,” continued
Dr. Fergus, clearing the fence as nimbly as a boy
and holding out a friendly hand to Betty; “unless,
of course, you’d rather stay outside.”
</p>

<p>
Stay outside!  It was with a wildly beating
heart, in which excitement and eagerness mingled,
that Betty followed the doctor through the wood.
</p>

<p>
There stood the cottage little and lonely as ever,
as they gained the clearing.  There, as they crossed
the threshold, lay, as before, a rough bordering
of flowers and ferns.  They had been picked two
days ago and were withered now.  And there, as
they entered the little inner room&mdash;filled with
withered flowers, surrounded with withered flowers,
and shinily polished as ever it had been when in
charge of the Daisy patrol&mdash;was the <i>Guide Cup</i>!
</p>

<p>
Somehow or other at that instant Betty’s eyes
filled with tears.  Her heart felt red-hot, and she
couldn’t speak.  Here was the lost Cup; but she
could only remember poor Paul who had tried to
“do something” for her; poor Paul who had
evidently watched her devotedly from the hollow
hiding-place in the ditch while she cleaned the Cup,
who had listened to her words, and who had put
his own simple construction on them, and who had,
so unintentionally, helped to bring so much trouble!
</p>

<p>
The doctor may have noticed her tears, or he
may not; he said nothing, but he bent down and
lifted up the Cup.  “We’ll take it back, just as
it is,” he said, “and explain to Miss Carey.  Oh
yes, I know all the ins and outs of the story from
Rene, and I believe you Daisies will hold the Cup
next year after all now, because&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
But Betty burst in with a choky half-sob.  “It
isn’t <i>that</i>.  I don’t believe the Daisies will even
<i>think</i> of that when they see it again!  I don’t
believe any of the Guides will, though it will be so
lovely to have it.  It’s&mdash;oh, it’s all so beautiful
and sad, all mixed up together, for the Cup really
to come back on Cup Day, and for me to be invested
with the Cup there, and yet for Paul&mdash;”  She broke
off.  “<i>That’s</i> what we’ll think of,” she choked.
</p>

<p>
“Look here, then,” said the doctor, placing the
Cup in her hands.  “Here’s an idea.  I understand
from Rene that you’re giving up mascoting to-day
when you become a Tenderfoot, eh?  Well, there’s
poor Paul, who hasn’t any one to care much about
him, and who seems to think an uncommon lot of
you Guides; suppose you adopt the poor chap as
mascot after this, eh?”  The doctor’s voice
was very cheery and kind.  “I know Miss Carey,
and I rather think&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Oh!</i>” cried Betty in her most motherly voice,
clasping the silver Cup with its burden of withered
flowers while tears of happiness and trouble chased
themselves down her cheeks.  “Oh! <i>do</i> let’s hurry
back to St. Benedick’s.  I truly believe that Sybil
and all the Guides will say that that would make
<i>everything</i> beautiful and right!”
